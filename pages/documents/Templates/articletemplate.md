## Titles

The overall title of the article is determined by the front-matter (by using the title parameter at its top). You shouldn't include it again inside the article, since this will create a confusing duplicate.

Since the overall title of the article will be [h2](https://www.quackit.com/html/tags/html_h2_tag.cfm), all subsequent titles within the article are h3. You achieve this by typing in `###` in Markdown before what you'd like the title to be and leaving it in a row of its own, like so:

`### h3 title`

## Other Titles

After h3, lower titles should proceed from there; sub-titles, like this section, will be h4 while h5 may also be used but is rather indistinguishable from **bold**. h6 will not be used; if you have more than three levels of sub-titles, re-consider your document's structure and how it can be better arranged.

**In Forestry, you can see the level of the titles to the left of them, in greyed out letters.** **When you hover over them, they turn black, making them easier to read.**

## Images

Inserting images with Forestry is easy. Simply click on the image icon in the Toolbar at the bottom of the editor, upload your image and then insert it.  A few guidelines for images:

* All images should be saved in a high resolution. Resizing will happen on the back-end, when the site is generated.
* When taking screenshots, we always prefer to capture the complete screen (for example, the complete LiveEngage workspace rather than a snippet of it) and highlighting the relevant areas weâ€™d like the user to pay attention to.
* Coloring of highlights on screenshots (like arrows or boxes) should be either black, red or blue, depending on the color scheme of the screenshot at hand. Maintain consistent coloring as much as possible in the same article.
* **You have two choices as far as positioning goes:**
  * If you do nothing, the image will be displayed in the **center** of the document, alone. That means that if you do nothing, you can't display images side by side.
  * If you want to display images side by side, you'll need to add the "sidebyside" class by adding {: .sidebyside} above the image you want to display. The images must be on the same line in the Markdown, like so:

    {: .sidebyside}
    ![image alt text](img/image_0.png)![image alt text](img/image_1.png)![image alt text](img/image_2.png)

## Adding Classes

{: .important}
Since this article doesn't have a Category, L2 Category _or_ L3 Category, its slug ends up being just the title. This will rarely happen but it's fine; the format for the slug assumes all those parts exist and if they don't, simply don't include them!

{: .notice}

## Videos

You have two ways to add videos to the site. One is simply leaving the link in the document and letting me know that I need to edit and add it.

The other is saving me some time by using the iframe below. Simply copy and paste the code below and make sure to change the video ID number; that's the number after /video! So in the example below, the number is 241513020. You can grab your video's ID from its original Vimeo link, which you should have.
