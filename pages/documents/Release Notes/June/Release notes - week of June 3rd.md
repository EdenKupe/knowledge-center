### New dashboard for analyzing survey results for Messaging in Report Builder

A new dashboard is now introduced, dedicated for reviewing and analyzing survey results in messaging conversations.

This dashboard will include the results to all types of surveys available for messaging channels - including the Post Conversation Survey (PCS), which was previously part of the predefined Messaging Performance dashboard, and any new type of survey that will be available in the future in LiveEngage (including Agent Survey, due later this year).

The new dashboard contains a tab named ‘Survey Data Export’ including 5 panels:

* Predefined survey KPIs
* Answers Distribution - Brand
* Answers Distribution - Agent & Skill
* Survey level analysis
* Question level analysis

The removal of the survey data from the Messaging Performance dashboard will allow to improve the loading time and optimize performance of this dashboard.

More info on reporting on PCS can be found [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/data-reporting-messaging-messaging-dashboards-messaging-survey-dashboard.html).

**How to enable**
