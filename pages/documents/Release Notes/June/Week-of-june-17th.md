While assigning conversations to agents, it is possible that certain skills would have no online agents that could receive the conversations. In such cases, brands need to be able to define a secondary fallback skill to which the conversation will be assigned.

Fallback skill per skill adds a new section under the skill settings in LiveEngage that enables brands to define the skill to which conversation will be routed if there are no online agents on the skill or if all agents are in an away status.

Queue prioritization - Priority based on consumer attributes

Enable brands to define business rules that would assign extra priority to specific conversations based on the consumer engagement attributes. The supported consumer attributes according to which the new business rules can be defined are listed in this link under:

* Consumer Info
* Personal Info

Example use case - â€œIf the customer associated with a conversation is either a VIP customer OR has a balance in his account of more than 2000 units OR registered with the company before 10.15.2014, assign a velocity of 15 to the conversation.
