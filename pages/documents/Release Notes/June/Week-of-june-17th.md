## Offsite engagements for messaging

### Type: New functionality 

Offsite engagements were available for web chat only until now, and will now be supported for web messaging as well. Brands can offer web messaging by adding an engagement link from any location and through media including: social media sites, email, digital advertising, and more. Brands can use this link anywhere they want to engage with their consumers. When setting up an offsite engagement, brands create a URL that will refer consumers to web messaging.

While assigning conversations to agents, it is possible that certain skills would have no online agents that could receive the conversations. In such cases, brands need to be able to define a secondary fallback skill to which the conversation will be assigned.

Fallback skill per skill adds a new section under the skill settings in LiveEngage that enables brands to define the skill to which conversation will be routed if there are no online agents on the skill or if all agents are in an away status.

* Consumer Info
* Personal Info

Example use case - â€œIf the customer associated with a conversation is either a VIP customer OR has a balance in his account of more than 2000 units OR registered with the company before 10.15.2014, assign a velocity of 15 to the conversation.

Agents will see conversations that are assigned to them. When an agent changes group, there may be some conversations not closed before changing groups. In that case conversation group will be different to the assigned agent's group. These conversations should be visible to the agent manager who manages the conversation's group and assigned agent of the conversation.

The Facebook handover protocol enables several Facebook Apps to collaborate within a single messaging thread. For example, it allows businesses to incorporate bots and human agents responses that are powered by different apps into a seamless conversation experience.

Facebook Handover Protocol enables two or more apps to participate in a conversation by passing control of the conversation between them.

This feature makes it possible to simultaneously use a 3rd party bot, outside of LiveEngage, for handling automated responses, and use LiveEngage for customer service with human agents.

By default, all messages are sent to the Primary Receiver app

When control of the conversation is passed to another, the Facebook Messenger Platform will send messages from the conversation to it instead.

Only one app may control the conversation at a time.

All apps that do not have control of the conversation may continue to listen to the conversation by subscribing to the standby webhook event.

**Dependencies**

* LE UI 10.8
* UMS 3.21

## Add Error to Apple Pay Response

</div>

Currently brands that are looking to use Apple Pay must have a bot added to the LE conversation via the Agent SDK. To reduce implementation effort, the ABC Payment response will be added to the Agent Widget SDK. The new flow will provide a way for brands to sign the payload, which will be verified by the connector before sending out to Apple.

* The Apple Pay responses will be exposed to the Agent Widget SDK public model structure
* Brands will be able to expose the Apple Pay response via the widget SDK methods to their backend auth servers in order to validate the token against their services
* Brands will be able to fetch user's payment information from their auth services after validating the token, while exposing the data to the agent on LE via a Customized Agent Widget
* If the payment fails, brands will be able to expose the failed response via the Agent Widget SDK and present the error response to the agent while allowing the agent to help the consumer to perform the payment successfully.
* The Apple Pay message response will be exposed to the agent widget SDK only in case the brands will use the payload signing mechanism to secure the data.

## Post conversation survey 

### Type: Bug fix

Post Conversation Survey (PCS) was not triggered for accounts post enablement of the agent group pre filtering feature. The PCS feature should now work for agents from any group if PCS feature is enabled for the account. 

## Automatic messages for non-main-group assigned agents 

### Type: Bug fix

Automatic messages were not working for non-main-group assigned agents. Controller bot- auto message feature should now work for agents from any group if the auto-message feature is enabled for the account.

## File sharing push notification 

### Type: Bug fix

File sharing push notifications prepend the camera emoji to caption text. This behavior should not be implemented in the back-end service. The callers of our API should not expect the text to be mutated as it moves through our system. If a camera emoji is needed in a notification somewhere, it should be up to the app/client to add it.

Additionally, we are prepending the sender name. If the caption is blank, we are substituting "sent you an image". Recently we added support for more file types (doc, ppt, xls, etc.) to file sharing. This message is no longer completely accurate.

Requirements & design work may be necessary here. If there are any implementations dependent on / expecting this behavior (e.g. agent mobile app), we may need to coordinate with that team to alter this behavior. Ultimately, from a UMS perspective, we should not be performing these changes in the back-end.

## Send CustomerInfoEvent and PersonalInfoEvent from SetUserProfile

### Type: Bug fix

In the All Connection page within LiveEngage, all consumers whose conversation was created from SendAPI, displayed as Visitor instead of their original name. The bug has now been resolved.

## Conversations stuck in the queue after transfer/Back2Q 

Intermittently when conversations get transferred or returned to queue, routing service throws an exception on an "undefined" agent name. Following this exception the conversations doesn't get routed to an agent and remains stuck in the destination queue. This bug has now been resolved.
