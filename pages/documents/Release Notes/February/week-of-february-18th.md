* Agents or bots will be able to see the contact information name, phone numbers, organization (company, department, title), email, birthday, address, and contact URL
* The contact info mentioned above will be displayed as a text message in the conversation, on behalf of the consumer lines.

Bug Fixes

## Back-end chat

### Automatic message timing is misbehaving (LE-89122)

Every time the visitor sends a message, the countdown is reset so potentially if a visitor sends a message every 2 minutes and the countdown is set to 3 minutes, the visitor will never receive the on-hold message.

Now, when a visitor sends the last message, the countdown timer starts the countdown from the last message until the agent sends a message, regardless of whether the visitor sent any further messages. The solution proposed is to remove the reset logic for the Staller timeout implementation.

### Updates to data masking configuration are not taking effect (LE-89023)

The configuration of data masking is performed in the Admin Area in Security > Data Masking.

There you can choose which Masking Patterns to use. However, although the options you choose are saved in the UI, the actual patterns used for masking the chat are not updated.

Now, the patterns are updated properly. The solution proposed is to implement the logic where data masking can be changed without having to restart the servers.

## Messaging connectors

### WhatsApp: Agent sending links to consumer causes an unexpected behavior (CX-21)

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web Messaging | Mobile App Messaging | SMS (Twilio) | Facebook | ABC | RCS Business Messaging | WhatsApp | Line | Google My Business |
| No | No | No | No | No | No | Yes | No | No |

If an agent attempts to send certain files via links to a consumer, it causes certain unexpected behavior, like redirecting to another link causing an infinite loop.

  
**Fix:** The message will be sent to the consumer as text message instead.

### Bad URLs on WhatsApp Container health check (CX-114)

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web Messaging | Mobile App Messaging | SMS (Twilio) | Facebook | ABC | RCS Business Messaging | WhatsApp | Line | Google My Business |
| No | No | No | No | No | No | Yes | No | No |

****

The URL pattern was not constructed properly with the location (brandâ€™s phone number). This caused timeouts which caused message delays issue in WhatsApp connector.

  
**Fix:** The URL pattern is now constructed properly and should not cause an issue.
