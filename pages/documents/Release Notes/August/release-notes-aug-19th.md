## Agent-group pre filter

### Type: Feature

Prefilter the open connections list by agent group, allowing agent managers to only see conversations of agent groups they manage instead of all agents.

This feature needs to be enabled internally by LivePerson

The scope is limited to the following user profiles:

### Agent Manager:

**LiveEngage - Open Connections Tab:** Agent group pre-filtered conversations including queued conversations

**Data bar:** Stats only on agent group pre-filtered conversations

**Notifications (for updates after initial subsc. call)**: Notification sent for new conversations, or updates to existing conversations that are assigned to agents in the agent manager groups. These conversations will become visible in LE.

Users can apply a filter on agent-groups through LiveEngage UI.

### Agent with view permission enabled

**Open Connections Tab:** all conversations from the agentâ€™s group including queued conversations

**Data Bar:** matches with open connection conversation data on the initial request

### Administrator and Agent Manager:
