## Messaging Conversation Segments

### Type: New functionality

The reality of messaging conversations today is that about 50% of interactions are transferred between skills. Many of the brands are also experiencing transfers between human agents.

In situations where multiple skills\\agents are assigned to each conversation, measuring the performance (e.g. time to first response) of each skill\\agent individually requires segmenting the conversation.

LiveEngage introduces a new segmentation model to measure each individual skill\\agent performance and present accurate KPIs per skill\\agent.

These new measurements and metrics are added to the Performance dashboard for Messaging in Report Builder.
