## \[LE UI\] Control group settings - Support additional control group sizes

### Type: New functionality 

LiveEngage supports the option to define a control group - a random number of visitors to your website who do not receive any type of engagement from a LiveEngage campaign, in order to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of campaigns (and your account as a whole).  
Up until today, LiveEngage supported the following increments: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% per account or per campaign.

We have added the option to configure a control group of any integer between 0% to 25% (increments of 1), to support more use cases to measure efficacy.

## Post conversation survey - Close reason on conversation separator in agent workspace

### Type: Enhancement

When a consumer receives a PCS survey at the end of the conversation and does not answer it or chooses to skip the survey, the agent workspace doesn't reflect the circumstances in which the survey ended. This information is important for Agent Managers to have some reassurance that the survey worked as expected, meaning that it expired after a reasonable amount of time and as configured. Today agent managers need to open a support ticket in order to gain visibility into the circumstances in which the survey ended. With this new enhancement, the separator line at the end of the survey will reflect the circumstances in which the survey ended e.g. survey skipped, ended, timed out, etc.

**Possible PCS close reasons:**

* Survey expired - The survey timed out, ignored, partially completed, partially completed and then skipped.
* Survey skipped - the survey was skipped, closed due to unrecognized user input or ended by the consumer.
* Survey closed - The survey was completed in full.

## Promotion (Launchpad) link in QuickLaunch menu

### Type: Enhancement 

Discoverability - exposing a dedicated unique link that will address a promotion page of all LivePerson’s products offerings.

The upcoming plan is to expose the ‘Launchpad LE-App’ in that link to make it discoverable and unique across other apps. The link will be visible once the Launchpad is deployed.
