As an agent manager, you want to have an overall picture of how your agents are performing at any given time. The data bar provides you with a snapshot of the basic information you need to track agent efficiency and operational performance.

The data bar default view presents aggregated data from all skills (queues) on the account for the last 12 hours.

The data bar default view presents aggregated data from all skills (queues) on the account for the last 12 hours.

### **Metrics**

**CONNECTED:** displays the number of connected chats between visitors and agents whether or not they interacted.

**ABANDONED:** displays the number of visitors that left the queue before connecting to an agent. Visitors abandon the queue for a number of reasons; they might just get tired of waiting.

**ABANDON RATE:** displays the percentage of visitors that abandoned the queue out of all visitors that entered the queue. Abandon rates should not exceed 5%.

**AVG TIME TO ABANDON:** displays the average time from the moment visitors enter the queue until they abandon it. Although you don’t have control over this number, it is useful for you to know the average length of time it’s taking for visitors to abandon the queue, so you can take action.

**AVG TIME TO ANSWER**: displays the average time from the moment that visitors enter the queue to the moment they connect with agents. As a rule of thumb, a good average time to answer is between 15 and 30 seconds. If the average time to answer is longer than 30 seconds, for example at peak hours, you may want to consider adding agents to this shift.

According to the data in the data bar, you can offer your agents constructive feedback to help shorten the average time to answer chats and lower the abandon rate, and adjust your staffing accordingly.

**Queue health dashboard (24 hours)**

The queue health dashboard graphically displays real-time and historical data that enables easily evaluation of agent efficiency. To access the queue health dashboard, click the pull-down button above the web visitors list.
