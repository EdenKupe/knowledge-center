## Agent level data sheet

* The predefined dashboard includes operational data for all messaging channels.
* The primary datasets: Agent and consumer messaging activity.
* Minimum timeframe: Hourly
* Primary Filters: _agent, agent group, skill, source type_

## Main panel: agent performance summary

The following panel will be presented when accessing the messaging performance predefined dashboard. It consists of an analysis of every messaging agent’s activity and performance. The default view summarizes the data for all agents, and offers dynamic filtering with the ability to select any of the agents on the list to show only their individual performance.

## Messaging metrics attribution to agent and skill

When computing a messaging related metric that should allow filtering by an agent or skill, an attribution model is applied. This is to resolve the inherent issue in messaging channels in which conversations may change hands and skills during their lifetime.

| Metric Name | Attribution to Agent | Attribution to Skill |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AVG. RESPONSE TIME BY AGENT | To the responding agent | To the skill assigned to the conversation when the response was given |
| AVG. RESPONSE TIME BY AGENT | To the responding agent | To the skill assigned to the conversation when the response was given |
| AVG. CONSUMER RESPONSE TIME | Not assigned to an agent | To the skill assigned to the conversation when the response was given |
| AVG. TIME TO AGENT FIRST RESPONSE | To the responding agent | To the skill assigned to the conversation when the response was given |
| MCS | To the last agent assigned to the conversation | To the last skill assigned to the conversation |
| CSAT SCORE | To the last agent assigned to the conversation | To the last skill assigned to the conversation |
| HANDLED CONVERSATIONS | To the agent who sent a message in the conversation, resumed it, or closed it | Skill assigned to the conversation in at least one of the events this metric calculates |
| TOTAL NO. OF TRANSFERS | To the agent who transferred the conversation | Skill assigned to the conversation when it was transferred out (origin skill) |
| AGENT RESPONSES PER CLOSED CONVERSATION | To the responding agent | Numerator - To the skill assigned to the conversation when the response was given / Denominator - To the last skill assigned to the conversation |
| TOTAL NO. OF AGENT RESPONSES | To the responding agent | To the skill assigned to the conversation when the response was given |
| TOTAL NO. OF CONSUMER RESPONSES | Not assigned to an agent | To the skill assigned to the conversation when the response was given |
| TOTAL NO. OF MESSAGES SENT BY AGENT | To the agent who sent the message | To the skill assigned to the conversation when the message was sent |
| TOTAL NO. OF MESSAGES SENT BY CONSUMER | Not assigned to an agent | To the skill assigned to the conversation when the message was sent |
| HANDLED CONVERSATIONS PER LOGIN HOUR | Not assigned to an agent | See logic for “NO. OF HANDLED CONVERSATIONS” |
| ACTIVE CONSUMERS | Not assigned to an agent | Not assigned to a skill |
| NO. OF OPENED CONVERSATIONS | To the agent who was assigned to the conversation at the time it was opened | To the skill the conversation was assigned to when it was opened |
| NO. OF CONVERSATIONS OPENED BY AGENT | To the agent who opened (resumed) the conversation | To the skill assigned to the conversation at the time the agent resumed it |
| NO. OF CONVERSATIONS CLOSED BY AGENT | To the user who closed the conversations (agent or agent manager) | To the skill assigned to the conversation at the time it was closed |
| NO. OF CONVERSATIONS CLOSED BY CONSUMER | The last agent assigned to the conversation | To the last skill assigned to the conversation |
| NO. OF CONVERSATIONS CLOSED BY SYSTEM | The last agent assigned to the conversation | To the last skill assigned to the conversation |
| AVG. CONVERSATION DURATION | To the last agent assigned to the conversation | To the last skill assigned to the conversation |
| INTERACTIVE / NON INTERACTIVE / ABANDONED CONVERSATIONS | To the last agent assigned to the conversation | To the last skill assigned to the conversation |
