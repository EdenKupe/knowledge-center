The new Bot Performance Dashboard enables brands to view and analyze their messaging bot performance over time, and measure the impact of agent annotations on the performance of bots designed by Conversation Builder. 

Using the new dashboard, brands can  track the bot funnel, including assigned conversations, handled conversations, intent match rate and conversations closed by the bot. 

The dashboard contains reports which display data at two levels:

**Brand level**: Enables users to track bot quality trends and the impact of annotations over time, including:
How many conversations are assigned to bots? How many are handled?
Whatâ€™s the intent match rate? Is it improving over time?
What is the annotation rate over time? What is the ROI of the annotations? 

**Bot level**: Enables users to analyze and optimize each bot, including: 
Does the intent match rate improve when we are investing the time to annotate?
What is the trend of unmatched intents? Has it decreased over time? 
Which bot annotations are submitted? Do all bots improve over time when annotations are added by agents?

## Primary datasets

* Messaging Intents activity
* Bot Intents annotation

## Primary filters

* Date
* Bot Name
* Skill

**Minimum time frame**: Hourly
