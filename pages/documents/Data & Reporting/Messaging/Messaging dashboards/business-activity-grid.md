The business activity grid spreads out all the funnel metrics in a granular view so any member on the account may receive scheduled copies to their email. 

Perform the analysis and customization you need using an offline copy, in excel using the complete business activity grid. You can choose the document type (daily/monthly) based on your needed timeframe. The daily grid gives daily aggregations for all the [metrics](https://developers.liveperson.com/essential-resources-report-builder-data-metrics.html#documenttitlecontainer) while the monthly grid offers the corresponding aggregations at the monthly level. The data is presented at the brand, campaign and engagement level.
