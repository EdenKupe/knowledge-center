The Report Builder uses a large amount of metrics to provide insightful and detailed reporting.

The table linked here outlines all of the data metrics available in the Report Builder, with their definition and location within the different dashboards. [You can find the table on our Developers' Community](https://developers.liveperson.com/essential-resources-report-builder-data-metrics.html).

More information on the Report Builder can be found [here](data-reporting-report-builder-report-builder-overview.html).
