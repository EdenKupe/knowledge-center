LiveEngage uses a large amount of metrics to provide insightful and detailed reporting.

The Report Builder offers brands ready-made dashboards reflecting historic data drawn from their LiveEngage account activity. These dashboards allow brands to monitor and optimize contact center operations, increase conversions through LiveEngage campaigns and enact data-driven decisions. All the data metrics available in the Report Builder, with their definition and location within the different dashboards can be found in our [Developers Community](https://developers.liveperson.com/essential-resources-report-builder-data-metrics.html)

We also have real-time data to give you an overall picture of how your contact center is performing at any given time. For all the data API's please see our [Developers Community.](https://developers.liveperson.com/essential-resources-api-data-metrics.html)
