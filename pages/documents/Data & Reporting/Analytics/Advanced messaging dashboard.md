Vision

Curate fit-for-purpose analyses that communicate the value of Messaging, highlight areas of opportunity,

and offer guidance on optimization.

Key Components of the Dashboard

● Monitor

○ Summary analyses clearly highlight Primary Messaging KPI trends over time to show

successes and opportunities for improvement.

● Diagnose

○ Detailed reporting allows the user to drill into segments of a program to pinpoint issues and

track improvement.

Test and Learn

One key objective of Advanced Messaging Dashboard 3.0 is to provide a platform to seamlessly

benchmark current performance, adjust program levers, and track incremental improvement. This applies

to account configuration, automation, and program operations.

Overview

Support

● Advanced Messaging Dashboard will ultimately be supported by LPSupport.

● For now, leverage #report_builder Slack channel for questions.

Edit Privileges and Best Practices for Account Teams

● This dashboard is a collaborative effort. Therefore, we welcome your ideas and encourage you to

use it as a platform to innovate upon.

● However, please be advised that analyses are carefully curated to tell a specific story. Any

customization on top of that analysis carries a risk of changing the narrative of the analysis.

● Please note that customizations will not be supported by LPSupport nor #report_builder at this time.

● If you do customize, please Save-As and give the file a different name.

How to use Tabs and Panels

Tabs

● Contain their own set of filters, meaning you have to set filters each time you switch tabs

● Typically contain between 3-8 Panels (see below)

Panels

● Correspond to individual components within an analysis

● Maintain the filters that are set at the tab level, meaning filters do not need to be reset when

navigating between panels

● May also contain filters within the visualization, allowing you to further drill down on the data that has

been selected at the Tab level.

How to use Filters within Tabs and Panels

Filters

● Tab Level

○ Apply to all Panels within a Tab

○ Default to past 28 days, all Skills, all

Groups, and all User Types
