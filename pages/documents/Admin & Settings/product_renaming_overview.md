## Hello, Conversational Cloud
For the past several years, LivePerson has helped leading brands become Conversational. Our platform enables agents and bots to handle inquiries from the most popular messaging channels, giving consumers an easy way to ask questions and make purchases.  

As more and more brands make the shift to Conversational, we are updating our product naming architecture to reflect this new way of operating.  LiveEngage is being renamed as the LivePerson Conversational Cloud. Please note that all functionality and user interface remains unchanged.

The Conversational Cloud is channel-agnostic and AI-powered. Brands can use the Conversational Cloud to discover and understand consumer intents, design and scale automations to fulfill those intents, and measure and optimize the effectiveness of conversations.

## Design & Scale with Conversation Builder, Manager and Orchestrator 
The Conversation Builder, Conversation Manager, and Conversation Orchestrator are the products that enable brands to build and manage AI-powered chatbots that work together with human experts to generate leads, drive sales, offer support, and build loyalty with brands.

| OLD NAME | NEW NAME | 
| --- | --- | 
| Maven | Conversation Orchestrator |
| Maven Assist - Bots| Agent Assist | 
| AI Powered Routing | Dynamic Routing | 

While the names Conversation Builder, Conversation Manager, and Context Warehouse are not changing, Maven and the Maven Workspace is now the Conversation Orchestrator. 

Conversation Orchestrator name signifies how this product connects to backend systems to help them work together seamlessly - such as Agent Assist, Dynamic Routing, Conversation Orchestrator APIs and more. From there, the Conversation Orchestrator collects intent, context (backend), and predictive attributes to help route customers to the most optimal bot, human agent, or relevant information. Brands can then design automations that fulfill specific intents, and scale by supervising automations with human agents and supporting agents through recommendations of  relevant information from a Knowledge Base, or suggesting a bot to join.
