The LivePerson platform is designed to reflect and support your brand goals and business structure as closely as possible. By creating individual Lines of Business (LoBs) within one single account, each with its own campaigns and engagements, brands are better able to track campaign success and engagement impact on each area of their business.

Each line of business will be set up with unique and siloed campaigns and reports. [Campaigns](contact-center-management-campaigns-campaigns-overview.html) will be assigned to a particular LoB, meaning that campaign managers will have access to all campaigns, with the ability to filter campaign lists and reports by LoB.
