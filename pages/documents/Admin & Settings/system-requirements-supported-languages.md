For the best LiveEngage experience, customers are required to use one of the certified operating systems and browser versions listed below. Using the latest browsers ensures better encryption, privacy support by default, and access to the full functionality of LiveEngage.

LivePerson is constantly expanding its matrix of supported operating systems and browser versions.

**Notes:**

We have two primary levels of support for the items listed in the tables below:

**Certified:** Items highlighted in orange are tested thoroughly by LivePerson. We are committed to resolving any bugs or issues based on the SLAs defined across LiveEngage.

## Desktop notifications

LiveEngage desktop notifications do not support the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer 11x

## Reporting

LiveEngage BI Dashboards do not support the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer 11x
* Microsoft Edge

While these browsers do support LiveEngage they do not support, and will not support, the BI dashboard. Users accessing the BI dashboards using these browsers may experience unexpected behaviors, such as missing scroll bars. The data in the dashboards may seem incomplete or missing when reviewing it without using scroll bars. To overcome this and see the full data, users can use the keyboard arrows.

## Bandwidth requirements

### LivePerson workspace

* Initial download speed: approximately 6MB GZIPPED for complete agent workspace download (includes scripts, html, CSS and images).
* Average rate per CCP per second: 10-15KB for data.
* Max rate per CCP per second: 1.2MB - 1.5M.
* Browser resource requirements: Typical agent activities with max 3 concurrent chats, client resource requirements can be summarized as:
  * Processor: Any 6th Gen Intel i3 processor. (i3-6098P is lowest cost one and is more than sufficient)
  * RAM - 2G
  * Network - 1G

## CoBrowse visitor side

* Recommended upstream bandwidth: 1500 Kbit/s.
* Large rendered websites > 2 MB (DOM tree) can lead to a significant delay until the website is fully visible to the CCP (waiting time 15 sec. or more to view the page).
* Your website should make sparse use of background animations (animations without user interaction).

{: .notice}
The real-time experience is affected by several applications competing for upstream bandwidth on the consumer’s system._

## Citrix requirements

LivePerson recommends hosting up to 30 users per server, with the following specifications:

* CPU: 4 Cores
* Memory: 16 GB RAM
* Xenapp Server 6.5 and above
* Operating system: Windows Server 2008 R2
