Bots can carry out a variety of automatic tasks and communicate with your consumers to help take the load off your agents. Any chat bot, created by you or a 3rd party, can be fully integrated into LivePerson and become a vital component of your customer care team.

## Benefits for brands and their contact center operations

Bots can have a dramatic impact on contact center operations, helping brands to:

* **Free up valuable agent time** — Bots can handle mundane and monotonous tasks to give human agents the time to focus on more complex conversations.
* **Build a strong and integrated contact center team** — Conversations can be passed back and forth between human and bot agents without a hitch, with human agents always available to speak to a consumer when the situation requires.
* **Reduce your customer care costs** — As a large number of common customer service interactions are highly automated, bots can step in to handle these routine tasks, dramatically cutting your contact center costs.
* **Track and monitor bots like any other agent** — A bot’s performance is measured against your KPIs, monitored in real time by Agent Managers and included in centralized reporting. Our detailed and flexible LivePerson reports allow for further analysis and bot performance optimization.

## Benefits for the consumer experience

* **Give consumers the best of both worlds** — Not only do your consumers get quick and easy answers from bots, but also, when necessary, more personal attention from your human agents.
* **Boost consumer satisfaction with more rapid response times** — By using automation, brands can supply more consumers with more answers - and at greater speed. With their issues being instantly attended to, consumers enjoy a better overall customer experience.
* **Enrich the consumer experience with structured content** — Pre-built templates and content make bots friendly and efficient for consumers. They provide clear communication with bots, so commands are more easily understood and responses are more accurate.
* **Meet consumer expectations for an always-on service** — Your consumers are connected 24/7 and expect your brand to be the same. Bots can step in at any time of day to field questions and offer round-the-clock assistance whenever your consumers need it.
