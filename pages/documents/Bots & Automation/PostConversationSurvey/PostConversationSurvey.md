### Tips on writing survey questions

* Keep the questions simple, clear and specific. 
* Avoid using jargon and double negatives.
* Make sure a question asks about only one thing.
* Don’t ask the same question more than once.
* Make most questions optional using the “skip” feature.
* Avoid leading questions that suggest an answer or convey an opinion, e.g., “How great was your experience today?”
* Make sure the answer choices are balanced and objective, i.e., don’t include just answer choices that reflect a positive opinion, also include those that don’t. 
* Minimize the use of open-ended questions that require free text responses, as these require more effort from the consumer.
* Ask the broader questions first.
