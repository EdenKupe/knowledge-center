## Agent Assist

Agent Assist improves productivity by recommending the best next actions ([Knowledge Base](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-knowledge-base.html) articles and/or bots) to agents in real time, based on the consumer’s intent.

The Conversation Orchestrator analyzes all available articles and bots for the identified intent and recommends the best ones in real time to the agent. Recommendations are made by choosing the highest ranked ones by score, after calibrating the score using a machine-learned signal about the historical performance.

Agents can opt to manually use a knowledge base article to help the user; or join a bot to the conversation, monitor, and remove the bot if needed.
