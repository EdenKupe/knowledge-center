## What is Context Warehouse


The context warehouse is a centralized repository of context attributes (brand, customer, conversational, session, and custom) that can be used to build customized conversation solutions.

Conversation Orchestrator provides three types of Context Attributes:

1. Inbox System Attributes (e.g. conversation history)
2. Custom attributes with static data or external system integrations with [Functions](liveperson-functions-overview.html)
3. Context session store with APIs to store and retrieve session context and carry them over the conversational journey

## Common Use Cases

Context warehouse attributes can be used in several ways:

1. Save conversation session state info in the Conversational Cloud (e.g. agent notes), and retrieve them later in a different conversation session.
2. Save contextual attributes in concierge bot (e.g. intents) and carry over context to another bot or human skill.
3. Use intents and entities from a bot, and use them in conjunction with system inbox attributes, or custom static or FaaS to create complex routing policies. See [Dynamic Routing](https://developers.liveperson.com/maven-ai-powered-routing-overview.html) to learn more about how to create such policies.

Brands can use and manage Context Warehouse from the Conversation Orchestrator Workspace:
