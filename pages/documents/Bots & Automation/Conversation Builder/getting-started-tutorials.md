## Dialogs and Patterns

Learn how to get started with some very basic bots. This tutorials explores the concept of [dialogs](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-tutorials-guides-getting-started.html#dialogs--patterns-tutorial) (the different conversation flows a bot can have) and [patterns](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-tutorials-guides-getting-started.html#dialogs--patterns-tutorial), which allow the bot to match user input and respond intelligently!

## Intents and Entities

In this video, we dive deeper into user input matching and look at the more advanced concepts of [intents and entities](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-tutorials-guides-getting-started.html#intents-tutorial). Intents allow you to use Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to enable your bot to more accurately match user input, while entities help with storing variable-like parameters for quick and easy data access!
