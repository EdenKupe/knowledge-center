Here are four tutorials videos to help you get started with our Conversation Builder. These videos cover the basic concepts and usage of the Conversation Builder, allowing you to get started with building great bots in a few minutes! These topics are also covered in more depth on [the Developers' Community](https://developers.liveperson.com/).

## Dialogs and Patterns

## Intents and Entities

In this video, we dive deeper into user input matching and look at the more advanced concepts of intents and entities. Intents allow you to use our powerful Natural Language Understanding (NLU) engine to enable your bot to more accurately match user input while entities help with storing variable-like parameters for quick and easy data access!
