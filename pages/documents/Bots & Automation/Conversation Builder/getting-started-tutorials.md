Here are six tutorials videos to help you get started with our Conversation Builder. These videos cover the basic concepts and usage of the Conversation Builder, allowing you to get started with building great bots in a few minutes! These topics are also covered in more depth in the [the Developer Center](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-tutorials-guides-getting-started.html)

## Dialogs and Patterns

Learn how to get started with some very basic bots. This tutorial explores the concept of [dialogs](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-tutorials-guides-getting-started.html#dialogs--patterns-tutorial) (the different conversation flows a bot can have) and [patterns](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-tutorials-guides-getting-started.html#dialogs--patterns-tutorial), which allow the bot to match user input and respond intelligently!

## Intents and Entities

In this video, we dive deeper into user input matching and look at the more advanced concepts of [intents and entities](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-tutorials-guides-getting-started.html#intents-tutorial). Intents allow you to use Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to enable your bot to more accurately match user input, while entities help with storing variable-like parameters for quick and easy data access!

## Advanced Interactions

This video covers more complex bot [interactions](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-interactions-interaction-basics.html), allowing you to present the user with multiple choice questions, messages with rich content, and more!

## Integrations

In this tutorial video, we explore [integrations](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-tutorials-guides-getting-started.html#integrations-tutorial), which allow a bot to query external APIs, bringing powerful new options to conversations. Use integrations to programmatically access catalogs, databases, and other web services to super power your bot responses!

## Deploy a bot

In this tutorial video, we will finally deploy our Getting Started bot to a live demonstration page. We will create a â€˜bot agent and skill, set up our web messaging engagement window, and connect our bot to our agent.

## Escalate to agent
In this video, we will demonstrate how to efficiently hand off to a human agent as needed. Despite everything that we can do for our users with automations, there are always going to be tasks that are best handled by a human on the other end of a messaging interaction.
