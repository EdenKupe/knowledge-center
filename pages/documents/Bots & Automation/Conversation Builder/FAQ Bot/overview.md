This guide will help step you through setting up a Knowledge Base (KB), and an FAQ Bot. This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the basic concepts and components of the Conversation Builder Platform. If you're not, we advise that you get started with some of our [more basic tutorials](conversation-builder-getting-started-hello-conversation-builder.html) or [documents](conversation-builder-overview-component-breakdown.html), which will introduce you to the platform in a more friendly way.

### What is an FAQ Bot?

The Conversation Builder Platform's Knowledge Base feature is described in depth [elsewhere in these documents](conversation-builder-knowledge-base-overview.html). However, that is an FAQ Bot? An FAQ Bot is a bot/automation which listens to [intents](conversation-builder-intent-builder-overview.html) in user input and attempts to match these intents with Knowledge Base article. An FAQ Bot can thus help your customers who are looking to dive deeper into your product by finding the right content at the right time, analyzing their intent to serve them with the most relevant content instead of forcing them to search for it on their own.
