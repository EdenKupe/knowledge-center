### Why brands need bots, automation and empowered agents

Today, conversations and messaging is the most effective way for brands to interact with consumers. Messaging makes it easy for people to ask questions, buy things, and get help using their preferred messaging service. Yet, messaging transforms how brands interact with consumers, creating large volumes of conversations from phone calls, websites and apps.

Once a brand embraces messaging they need a way to scale their contact center operations in order to support the personalized, accessible, and always-on relationship that messaging enables. LivePerson is leading the industry in the adoption of messaging through a conversational platform that combines bots, automaton and AI to enable this scalable transformation.

Our Conversation Builder is an all-in-one platform for easily building automations and bots that are tailor-made to be effective in conversational commerce. From creating intents and building dialogues, to back-end integrations that connect to all consumer messaging channels and everyday systems, like Salesforce, the Conversation Builder provides brands with an easy-to-use bot builder that allows non-technical staff, often the people who best understand a brand’s voice,  to create, optimize and visualize bots. 

## Top capabilities of the Conversation Builder

**LivePerson built the Conversation Builder as a dialogue-based tool for creating automations and bots at scale**. Brands can leverage non-technical staff to build, optimize, and improve bots and automated conversation flows. The result is bots that are more effective and competent, and drastically speeds up bot development and optimization.

### **One-stop-shop to build and visualize bots**
Automations can require complex development with heavy reliance on developers and involved integrations. The Conversation Builder  uniquely lets brand build and visualize dialogues flows in a single UI. As a dialogue is created, the “Assist” capability provides guidance by automatically identifying consumer intent and making suggestions. 

### **Agents as collaborators in training & optimization**
The best people to train bots are human agents who are experts in conversations. Typically, agents are disconnected from the development and optimization process conducted by data scientists, developers or product managers. The Conversation Builder replaces the code-based programming required by most automation platform, and allows non-technical staff, like bot managers, agent managers and even qualified agents, to be hands-on building and training bots.

### **Out-of-the-box automations for common workflows and verticals**
Brands don’t need to start from scratch to build bots - they can leverage the Conversation Builder’s built-in automation templates for common workflows and channels as accelerators including:
* Industry-specific templates for common workflows and verticals, such a retail, telecommunications and finance. These templates provide a starting point on which to build, customize and integrate with product, billing, CRM and other business systems like Shopify, Salesforce, Timetrade, Hybris. 
* Integration with product catalogues, order systems, knowledge bases, and more.
* And the option to leverage pre-existing automation and NLU investments including DialogFlow, Watson, Lex and other NLU providers.
 
This allows brands to, for example, quickly connect their product catalogue.

### **Connect to messaging channels & business systems with full integration**
As part of LivePerson’s conversational commerce platform, bots and automations built with the Conversation Builder can be instantly connected to all messaging channels, and show up in the real-time monitoring and reporting. 


### Agent-bot tango
The integraiton also allows for seamless back and forth escalation with human agents who can supervise bots as they work. Agents can intervene seamlessly to pick up conversations where bots cannot continue. We call this the human-bot tango. Bot managers or qualified agents have the tools to teach bots to deliver a great consumer experience by changing the introduction text or question, supervise bots as they work, and intervene to rescue consumers or pick up conversations where bots cannot continue. In this way, agents and bots can tango - an instrumental capability in helping brands maintain a positive user experience.

## How the Conversation Builder works

### Brands who want to build bots

Bots can be built with the Conversational Builder through an interactive dialog builder, or by selecting from a library of pre-built, industry-specific automations. The pre-built set of industry vertical bots allows brands to deploy out-of-box automations across the most common workflows tuned for each industry, e.g. templated bots libraries by industry and out of the box automation for top intents in retail, telco and others-- enabling rapid adoption of automation.

Using inputs and prompts and a point-and-click interface, bots are built based on simple dialog, not complicated coding algorithms. Brands can then **easily design, build, and optimize high-impact conversations at scale.**

By allowing contact center managers, agents and agents managers to create and manage bots, the Conversation Builder helps brands create bots that forge relationships with brands just as they talk to one another, through natural language and dialogue.

### Brands who want to bring their own bot

The Conversation Builder offers a high-value solution for brands to address a wide variety of automation workflows and use cases in multiple industries.  However, brands who want to bring their own bots can still integrate any third-party bot technology.  This is one of the main benefits of LivePerson as an open, conversational platform.
