### Why brands need bots, automation and empowered agents

Today, conversations and messaging is the most effective way for brands to interact with consumers. Messaging makes it easy for people to ask questions, buy things, and get help using their preferred messaging service. Yet, messaging transforms how brands interact with consumers, creating large volumes of conversations from phone calls, websites and apps.

Once a brand embraces messaging they need a way to scale their contact center operations in order to support the personalized, accessible, and always-on relationship that messaging enables. LivePerson is leading the industry in the adoption of messaging through a conversational platform that combines bots, automaton and AI to enable this scalable transformation.

The Conversation Builder is a codeless, easy-to-use bot builder that allows non-technical staff such as agents — the people who best understand a brand’s voice and how best to communicate to consumers authentically— to create, tweak and build bots. Using the Conversation Builder, brands can create **bots that combines the power of machine learning with the insight and experience of brand employees - the agents - to scale with messaging**. 

## Solving major challenges of bot building 

The Conversation Builder was created to address a set of challenges that typically comes with building bot:

* **Complex development** - Automations can be complex with heavy reliance on developers and involved integrations. The Conversation Builder replaces the code-based programming required by most automation platform, allowing any non-technical staff to build bots.
* **Training & optimization** - The best people to train bots are human agents who are experts in conversations. Typically, agents are disconnected from the development and optimization process conducted by data scientists, developers or product managers. With the Conversation Builder, contact center manager, agents and agent managers — the people who bring emotional intelligence and best represent the brand’s voice — can optimize, and improve conversational flows.

## What is the Conversation Builder

### LivePerson’s bot builder

**LivePerson built the Conversation Builder as the first codeless, dialogue-based tool for creating automated conversations at scale**. Because brands can leverage non-technical staff, such as contact center and agent, to build, optimize, and improve bots and automated conversation flows, resulting in the creation of bots that are more effective and competent.

Agents have the tools to teach bots to deliver a great consumer experience by changing the introduction text or question, supervise bots as they work, and intervene to rescue consumers or pick up conversations where bots cannot continue. In this way, agents become bot managers and are instrumental in helping brands create powerful, effective bots.

## How the Conversation Builder works

### Brands who want to build bots

Bots can be built with the Conversational Builder through an interactive dialog builder, or by selecting from a library of pre-built, industry-specific automations. The pre-built set of industry vertical bots allows brands to deploy out-of-box automations across the most common workflows tuned for each industry, e.g. templated bots libraries by industry and out of the box automation for top intents in retail, telco and others-- enabling rapid adoption of automation.

Using inputs and prompts and a point-and-click interface, bots are built based on simple dialog, not complicated coding algorithms. Brands can then **easily design, build, and optimize high-impact conversations at scale.** 

By allowing contact center managers, agents and agents managers to create and manage bots, the Conversation Builder helps brands create bots that forge relationships with brands just as they talk to one another, through natural language and dialogue. 

### Brands who want to bring their own bot

The Conversation Builder offers a high-value solution for brands to address a wide variety of automation workflows and use cases in multiple industries.  However, brands who want to bring their own bots can still integrate any third-party bot technology.  This is one of the main benefits of LivePerson as an open, conversational platform.
