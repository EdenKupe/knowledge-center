### Why brands need bots, automation and empowered agents

Today, conversations and messaging is the most effective way for brands to interact with consumers. Conversational commerce makes it easy for people to ask questions, buy things, and get help using their preferred messaging service. Yet, messaging transforms how brands interact with consumers, creating large volumes of conversations from phone calls, websites to apps and messaging channels.

Once a brand embraces messaging they need a way to scale their contact center operations in order to support the personalized, accessible, and always-on relationship that messaging enables. LivePerson is leading the industry in the adoption of messaging through a conversational platform that combines bots, automaton and AI to enable this scalable transformation. The Conversation Builder is an all-in-one platform for easily building automations and bots that are tailor-made to be effective in conversational commerce.

### Unique benefits of the Conversation Builder

Our Conversation Builder allows brands to build bots including everything from creating intents and building dialogues, to back-end integrations that connect to all consumer messaging channels and everyday systems, like Salesforce. The Conversation Builder provides brands with an easy-to-use bot builder that allows non-technical staff, often the people who best understand a brand’s voice,  to create, optimize and visualize bots.

_Conversation Builder (dialog-based bot building)_

LivePerson built the Conversation Builder as a dialogue-based tool for creating automations and bots at scale. This allows brands to leverage non-technical staff to build, optimize, and improve bots and automated conversation flows - creating bots that are more effective and competent, and drastically speeding up bot development and optimization.**The result is bots that are more effective and competent, and drastically speeds up bot development and optimization.**

## Top capabilities of the Conversation Builder

### **One-stop-shop to build and visualize bots**

Automations can require complex development with heavy reliance on developers and involved integrations. The Conversation Builder  uniquely lets brand build and visualize dialogues flows in a single UI. As a dialogue is created, the “Assist” capability provides guidance by automatically identifying consumer intent and making suggestions.

### **Connect to messaging channels & business systems with full integration**

As part of LivePerson’s conversational commerce platform, bots and automations built with the Conversation Builder can be instantly connected to all messaging channels, and show up in the real-time monitoring and reporting.

### **Agents as collaborators in training & optimization**

The best people to train bots are human agents who are experts in conversations. Typically, agents are disconnected from the development and optimization process conducted by data scientists, developers or product managers.

The Conversation Builder replaces the code-based programming required by most automation platform, and allows non-technical staff, like bot managers, agent managers and even qualified agents, to be hands-on building and training bots.

Together with integration to LivePerson's conversational commerce platform, there exists a seamless back and forth escalation with human agents who can supervise bots as they work. Agents can intervene to pick up conversations where bots cannot continue - what we call the human-bot tango. Bot managers or qualified agents have the tools to teach bots to deliver a great consumer experience by changing the introduction text or question. In this way, agents and bots can tango - an instrumental capability in helping brands maintain a positive user experience.

### **Predefined, industry vertical templates**

Brands don’t need to start from scratch to build bots. Conversation Builder has a set of predefined, industry vertical templates (e.g., retail, telecommunications, and finance) that enable rapid adoption of automation. Each conversational template consists of the following capabilities:

* Intents associated with the use case
* Conversational dialogs with appropriate interactions for the respective channels or end points (e.g. Web, Apple Business Chat, SMS etc.)
* API integrations with industry leading services (e.g. Shopify, Salesforce, Timetrade, Hybris) as well as brand-specific services
*  Integration with product catalogues, order systems, knowledge bases, and more.
* And the option to leverage pre-existing automation and NLU investments including DialogFlow, Watson, Lex and other NLU providers.

For example, a brand can use a prebuilt retail template from the automation library, edit the script to customize it according to their brand lingo, and immediately integrate to Shopify or connect their product catalogue.

## How the Conversation Builder works

Leverage LivePerson’s Conversation Builder with native bots:
Bots can be built with the Conversational Builder through an interactive dialog builder, or by selecting from a library of pre-built, industry-specific automations. The pre-built set of industry vertical bots allows brands to deploy out-of-box automations across the most common workflows tuned for each industry, e.g. templated bots libraries by industry and out of the box automation for top intents in retail, telco and others-- enabling rapid adoption of automation.

Using inputs and prompts and a point-and-click interface, bots are built based on simple dialog, not complicated coding algorithms. Brands can then **easily design, build, and optimize high-impact conversations at scale.**

By allowing contact center managers, agents and agents managers to create and manage bots, the Conversation Builder helps brands create bots that forge relationships with brands just as they talk to one another, through natural language and dialogue.
