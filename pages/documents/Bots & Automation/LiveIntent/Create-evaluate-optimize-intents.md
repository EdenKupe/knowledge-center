New Self Service Intent Discovery and Optimization features enable brands to tune their Intent taxonomy and deploy improved models within minutes. Brands can now easily mine their conversation data to discover and build new intents from one unified interface. They can also correct misclassified messages and feed those annotations back into their model as new training phrases to improve recognition quality.

## How to enable
Intent Discovery & Optimization is enabled by default for all Intent Analyzer customers. If you wish to disable, please contact your LivePerson account team.

## Step 1: Understanding your existing model
When you begin, first take a look at how the existing model is performing. There are a few key things to take note of: coverage, intent names, and the existing training data. 

1 - First, to easily gauge the coverage of the current model, visit the Intent Analyzer Dashboard as seen below, and check the “top intents” pie chart:

Look for how much of the pie chart undefined occupies. If it is very low, i.e. ¼ or less of the pie chart, it is unlikely that there will be many intents to discover. Take this into consideration as you proceed.
