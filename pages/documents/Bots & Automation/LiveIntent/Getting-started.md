## Getting Started

To enable the LivePerson Intent Analyzer on your account, please contact your LivePerson account representative.

### Permissions
LivePerson's Intent Analyzer inherits its permission structure from Conversation Builder, as the primary admin/ configuration work is related to setting up intents and training models in Intent Builder. Therefore, LivePerson's Intent Analyzer also requires Conversation Builder permissions to be turned ON in Administrator Profile, if not already done so.

Access to LivePerson's Intent Analyzer dashboard is currently granted to the following roles:
* CB_VIEW_ANALYTICS
* BOT_BUILDER_ADMIN
* BOT_BUILDER_BOTS
* BOT_BUILDER_CONTENT_USER
* BOT_BUILDER_BUSINESS_USER
* LPA

## Managing user access
In order for a user to access Intent Analyzer, they must be assigned a profile that has at least one of the following permissions:
* Conversation Builder: Administrator OR
* Conversation Builder: Content User OR
* Conversation Builder: Business User OR
* Conversation Builder: Bot Builder

## Starter Pack Quick Start

If you do **not** already have intents created in Intent Builder, and if you would like to **get up to speed quickly**, LivePerson's Intent Analyzer offers starter packs filled with common intents for various different business verticals. These starter packs leverage your historical transcript data to automatically create a model for your brand.

### Once you're set up - optimize your intent taxonomy using the Intent Discovery and Optimization tools

The Intent Discovery and Optimization tools enable you to quickly uncover patterns in your existing data, better discover high impact intents, and automatically develop training phrases to train your machine learning models. It makes it easy for you to annotate incorrectly classified messages so that models can be improved and new intent classes can be created. With these enhancements you can now quickly tune your own Intent taxonomy and deploy new Machine Learning models within minutes, without assistance from LivePerson.

If you have **intents in an external system**, you can [import](https://developers.liveperson.com/intent-builder-overview.html#adding-a-domain) those into Intent Builder to get started quickly.

If you have **intents in Intent Builder** already, [see here](https://developers.liveperson.com/intent-builder-overview.html#intent-analyzer) for how to enable them in Intent Analyzer.
