The vision of the Intent-Driven Business is to fundamentally change how brands understand and act on what their consumers want and need - not through proxies like website click patterns - but in consumers’ own intents. Intent Manager is foundational to this vision enabling brands to Discover, Build, Analyze, and Optimize state of the art ML models for intent classification with intuitive self-service tooling.

Intent Manager 2.2 introduces unified navigation of all Intent Manager components (Intent Builder, Intent Analyzer, AI Annotation) under a shared Intent Manager user interface, as well as some new product enhancements. 

See some of the new features and exciting enhancements coming to Intent Manager:

## Unification of all Intent Manager components
In the Conversational AI section, a new Intent Manager button will serve as the single point of entry for all Intent Manager components, including Intent Builder and Intent Analyzer.. The Intent Manager unification improves the user experience as navigation is faster and more intuitive.

The update Includes a new Intent Manager homepage where users can view key coverage and quality stats. The new Information Architecture combines the four key elements of Intent Management into one unified navigation experience (Discover, Build, Analyze, Optimize):

* Discover: Explore topic clusters in historical conversations to Discover and define new customer intents and associated training phrases
* Build: Build, Train, Test, and Activate ML models
* Optimize: Leverage Agents to annotate messages for optimized intent models
* Analyze: Analyze patterns in consumer intent and associated KPIs to derive insights that drive business decisions and operational actions.


Navigation between Intent Manager sections (Discover, Build, Optimize, Analyze) is seamless and coherent. For brands that do not have Intent Analyzer enabled Analyze and Discovery features will be “locked”.

### New Intent Manager Dashboard

There is a new Intent Manager Dashboard that provides a high level overview of Domains, Intent Coverage, and Intent Quality. From the dashboard you can control settings and quickly navigate to the Discover, Build, Optimize, and Analyze sections of Intent Manager for each Domain.

## Multi-domain support
Intent Manager 2.2 also introduces multiple intent domain support, making it possible to evaluate each consumer message against multiple machine learning models in real time, with the ability to process and store classifications from multiple Intent Domains simultaneously (up to 5 domains).

Domains are selected from Intent Manager instead of from Intent Builder.
Multi-domain opens the door for brands to:
Develop and A/B test new domains
Support more than one language per account
Support multiple lines of business
Independently tune models for specific use cases: sales and marketing, churn detection and escalation, social media monitoring, specialized bots and automation
