The vision of the Intent-Driven Business is to fundamentally change how brands understand and act on what their consumers want and need - not through proxies like website click patterns - but in consumers’ own intents. Intent Manager is foundational to this vision enabling brands to Discover, Build, Analyze, and Optimize state of the art ML models for intent classification with intuitive self-service tooling.

Intent Manager 2.0 introduces a wide set of new self-service features and functionality that greatly improve the value and utility of the application making it easier than ever for brands to fully manage their Intents on the LivePerson Platform. 

Here are all the new features and exciting enhancements coming to Intent Manager:

## Topic Clustering for Intent Discovery and Optimization (new)

Optimizing the coverage and quality of intents is a critical component of Intent Management. Intent Manager 2.0 introduces new language clustering visualizations that help brands discover new topics and trends in their conversational data. 

###What are clusters?
Clusters are groupings of messages that share similarities in language. Messages in each cluster share a noun (such as the word “order”), and each cluster contains sub-clusters that have noun-verb combinations such as “place order” or cancel order”. Both clusters and sub-clusters provide an intuitive way to identify common combinations of phrases that consumers are using to express their intent. When used in combination with various search and filter criteria, clusters can be used to identify opportunities to further develop your intent taxonomy and help define ways to optimize your intent model.

Brands can combine the power of clustering with Semantic Search and power filters to quickly build new, high-quality intents, which are based on a diverse set of training data that has been extracted from real customer conversations.

The new Intent Directory pop-over enables you to see all the intents and training phrases used in a single place. You can access it by clicking on the orange icon on the bottom right corner of the screen. The Intent Directory and improved integration with Intent Builder makes it easier than ever to correct misclassified messages and tune the overall recognition quality of their ML models without a dependency on specialized data scientists.

It is important to note that the Messages table view has moved to the Intent Discovery tab (from the Conversation Details tab). The Intent-detection coverage widget (classified vs unclassified message count). [Insert Image 3]
