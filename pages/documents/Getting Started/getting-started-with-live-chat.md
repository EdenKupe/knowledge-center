## Bare-bones: get to the first message

To get the most basic version of messaging up means you have a generic ‘chat’ button your website and there will be no routing - all agents will receive all messages. Getting to the first message is simple and can be done through three steps:

1. Your developers or website administrator need to add the LivePerson tag (piece of code) to every page of the website.  For instructions on how to get the code, click here. 
2. Create users for the agents that will be taking the conversations.  To learn how to set up users, click here.
3. Once the code is up and an agent is logged into the system, they must put their status to ‘online’. Doing so will automatically enable the chat button on the website to begin accepting incoming chats.

## Set up data for accurate tracking

Adding more data will enable you to do three things within LivePerson: better target customers, arm agents with more information, and get more granular and accurate reporting. 

In addition to adding the LivePerson tag to all your website pages, you can also do the following: 

* Send LivePerson information about your consumers such as items added to their shopping cart, account status and more. We call these engagement attributes.  Developers can add engagement attribute tracking directly into the LivePerson tag. Another way to send attributes to LivePerson is by a method called scraping. 
* Determine the attribution model.  Often times, consumers don’t purchase something on their first visit to your site.  Engagement attributes such as conversions can be tracked across different sessions, or customer visits. The attribution model enables you to select how you want to attribute cross session conversions to agents who handled the conversation.
* If you sell into multiple countries and enable various currencies, you can set up LivePerson to track multiple currencies for purposes of accurate conversion tracking and reporting. 

## Customize your messaging program

  
LivePerson is the most advanced platform for any size organization, offering a slew of customization capabilities.  To ensure you are getting the most out of web messaging, develop and set up your preferences in three areas:

* **Customer experience:** design what your consumers will see when they interact with you - including the messaging window,  the banners, buttons and automatic text. Add bots and automation to be the first to answer.
* **Agent experience**: Set up agent experience to ensure your reps are successful including predefined content and custom widgets 
* **Management & Operations**: Cost savings are a product of effective operations: set up all your skills and LOBs, routing, agent capacity, & queue priority

This guide will provide a checklist for actions you can take for each of the above areas.

## Design the customer experience

1. **Define the look, feel and behaviour or chat buttons and windows:**

LivePerson ‘campaigns’ provide you with granularity to define many aspects of the chat look and feel as well as the behaviour buttons on your website, including:

* Chat button look and feel
* Chat window look and feel
* Rules to trigger button appearance on your web pages
* Surveys
* Proactive invitations

**2. Rich Messaging**: enhancing the conversation is crucial to enable you to handle more types of inquiries and actions over messaging. Beyond the regular text, LivePerson enables you to set up the following rich messaging capabilities:

* Photo sharing (consumer to agent)
* Structured content (cards, carousels, lists)

**3. Add bots**: create a better customer experience by greeting your consumers with a great bot that can immediately answer some of their questions, or route the conversation accordingly.  You can create bots easily using the LivePerson Conversation Builder.

**4. Secure forms**: you can take payments or verify secured identify of customers using the pci-compliant secure form within the conversation window. 

## Define the  agent experience

1. **Predefined answers**: create or import a database of answers that your agents can quickly enter into the conversation, saving them valuable typing time. These can be defined by skill and by language. 
2. **Custom agent tools**: within the agent workspace, ‘widgets’ contain additional tools, webpages or applications that agents can use during the conversation.  The most popular custom widget is CRM integration that pulls up the record of the customer in an active conversation.
3. **Multiple away states**: by default, your agents can be ‘online’ and available to take messages, ‘busy’, or ‘away’.  These status affect the flow of new incoming conversations to the agents.  You can customize the states agents can choose from to get better granularity on agent tiem reporting - e.g. create an away state for training. 
4. **Configure cobrowse**: For high touch conversations, agents can connect to customers screens and conduct a cobrowse session.  Administrators can define and determine which agents have this capability. 
5. **Agent Guide**: Get your agent trained on how to take messages.  Note that agent training should include your business processes as well as best practices for conducting conversations.  LivePerson has developed an expertise in agent training that substantially increases performance.  To learn more, visit the LivePerson University or contact your account team for specialized training. 
6. **SSO Login**: you have the option to connect LivePerson to your company’s secured hub for SSO integration. 

## Management and operations

1. **Account security settings**: review the security recommendations and apply standards based on your brands requirements. 
2. Account Administration: 

* **Skills**: set up or import the list of skills that you’d like conversations routed to
* **Users**: set up or import the list of all agents, managers or administrators.  
* groups/LOB: set up groups or lines of business to reflect how your contact center is organized.  These will reflect in your reporting, as well as enable filtering for agents and managers to only see conversations and data relevant to them. 
* **Permissions**: you can customize what actions your users can take in the system.  For example, create a ‘supervisor’ role with permissions to set up and add users.
* **Timezone**: set up the timezone of your account for timestamp and reporting purposes.
* **Languages**: setup the language for Agent Workspace.  For a list of available languages, click here.   

  
3\.  Fine tune operations for greater efficiencies:

* Queue Prioritization: rank the order in which oncoming conversations come into the agent queue
* Automatic Conversation Distribution: how incoming chats are distributed amongst your agents 
* Workload distribution between agent groups
* How to Use 'Ignore Max Wait Time 
* Wrap-up time for chat
