## Step 2: Add the LiveEngage Tag to your website

Copy and paste the LiveEngage tag into your website's `<head>` section. The tag should be included as high up in the `<head>` section as possible. For more information, click [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/getting-started-add-the-liveperson-tag-to-your-website.html).

**Tip:** You can also test the web messaging experience without adding the LiveEngage tag to your site by using this [tool](https://developers.liveperson.io/web-messaging/).

## Step 3: Setup a new messaging campaign

In LiveEngage, first click on **Campaigns** at the top of the screen. Select the default campaign ("Live Chat on your site") and click **Unpublish** to disable this campaign. Next, click the **Add campaign** button at the bottom left of the screen. Click **Add goal**, select **Interact with consumers** and click **Done** at the bottom right. You can read more about goals [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/contact-center-management-campaigns-campaign-goals.html). Click **Add engagement** and select **Web.** Choose any of the available engagement types and then continue clicking **Next** until the **Done** button is available. Click **Done**. Click **Publish** at the top right to publish your campaign. You can read more about campaigns [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/contact-center-management-campaigns-campaigns-overview.html).

## Steps 4: Send and receive web messages

Load the website that you inserted your LiveEngage tag into. If youâ€™ve successfully completed Steps 1-3, the engagement button that you selected in Step 3 will appear. Click on the engagement button and send a message. The message will appear in LiveEngage. Clicking "Accept" will allow you to respond.

**NOTE**: In this setup, every agent will receive all messages. To learn more about advanced messaging configuration and routing for your account, click here. please see [this document](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/getting-started-getting-started-with-messaging.html).
