Setup a "Hello World" automation using Conversation Builder

## Step 1: Add Conversation Builder permissions to administrators

Once logged into LiveEngage, click on the ‘Users’ tab at the top of your screen. Then select ‘Profiles’ and then ‘Administrators’. Enable the following permissions:

* Admin in Conversation Builder
* Content User in Conversation Builder
* Business User in Conversation Builder
* Operations in Conversation Builder
* Bot Builder in Conversation Builder

Click Save.

## Step 2: Login to Conversation Builder

To access Conversation Builder, first login to [LiveEngage](https://authentication.liveperson.net/). When logged in, click the **Automation tab** at the top of your screen. Click the **Conversation Builder** icon in the left hand side-bar and then the **Conversation Builder** icon that appears on the screen.

## Step 3: Create a new bot

Click **new automation**, then select the **Basic Automation** template. Give your automation a unique name, a description and leave the Automation Type set to Consumer Facing Automation. Click **Create Automation**.

## Step 3: First interaction

To start interacting with the Basic Automation, click on the **Preview** icon in the bottom-right of the screen to open the Preview window. Enter "reset" in the Preview window to start a new session. This template includes a Dialog called “Welcome” that matches and responds to simple patterns such as “hello”. Enter “hello” in the Preview window and you will see the response “Hi there! Thanks for coming!”

## Step 4: Hello World!

You will see two small icons to the left of the **Assist** window.  Click on the **Interaction Details** icon.
