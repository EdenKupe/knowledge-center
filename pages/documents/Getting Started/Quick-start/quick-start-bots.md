Bots and large-scale automations transform how brands interact with consumers, enabling one-to-one interactions that replace the IVR, websites, and apps with conversations. Bots can carry out a variety of automatic tasks and communicate with consumers to help take the load off agents. To build bots for your LiveEngage account, we'll be using the **Conversation Builder**.

To access the Conversation Builder, click the **Automation tab** at the top of your LiveEngage screen. From there, click on the **Conversation Builder icon** in the left hand side-bar and then click on the **Conversation Builder icon** on the screen which opens.

Please watch the videos below to get started quickly with building a bot through the Conversation Builder. You can also head on over to the [Developers' Community](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-platform-overview.html) to read more about the Conversation Builder and advanced usage.

### Dialogs and Patterns

Learn how to get started with some very basic bots. This tutorials explores the concept of dialogs (the different conversation flows a bot can have) as well as patterns, which allow the bot to match user input and respond intelligently! If you prefer a textual guide, check out this [guide](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-getting-started-1-dialogs-and-patterns.html).

### Intents and Entities

In this video, we dive deeper into user input matching and look at the more advanced concepts of intents and entities. Intents allow you to use our powerful Natural Language Understanding (NLU) engine to enable your bot to more accurately match user input while entities help with storing variable-like parameters for quick and easy data access!

### Integrations

In this final tutorial video, we'll explore integrations which allow your bot to query external APIs, bringing powerful new options to your conversations. Use integrations to programmatically access catalogs, databases, and other web services to super power your bot responses!
