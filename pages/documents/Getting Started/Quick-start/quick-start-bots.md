Bots and large-scale automations transform how brands interact with consumers, enabling one-to-one interactions that replace the IVR, websites, and apps with conversations. Bots can carry out a variety of automatic tasks and communicate with consumers to help take the load off agents. To build bots for your LiveEngage account, we'll be using the **Conversation Builder**.

To access the Conversation Builder, click the **Automation tab** at the top of your LiveEngage screen. From there, click on the **Conversation Builder icon** in the left hand side-bar and then click on the **Conversation Builder icon** on the screen which opens.

Please watch the video below to get started quickly with building a bot through the Conversation Builder. You can also head on over to the [Developers' Community](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-platform-overview.html) to read more about the Conversation Builder and advanced usage.
