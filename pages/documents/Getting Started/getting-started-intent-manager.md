The vision of the Intent-Driven Business is to fundamentally change how brands understand and act on what their consumers want and need - not through proxies like website click patterns - but in consumers’ own intents. LivePerson’s Intent Analyzer allows you to do this and you can get up and running very quickly with Prebuilt Domains.

## What is the Intent Analyzer 

The Intent Manager accurately understands what consumers want. It empowers brands to build an intent taxonomy, analyze the most popular consumer intents, optimize how well they are being fulfilled, and discover intents that can or should be automated. The Intent Manager is made up of the Intent Builder and the Intent Analyzer.

Intent Manager’s proprietary natural language understanding (NLU) engine extracts consumer intentions at every turn of the conversation. Intent Manager comes pre-configured for a variety of industries, to automatically understand a high percentage of consumer intents entirely out-of-the-box. It offers flexibility for data scientists, content creators, and non-technical employees to fine-tune or configure custom intents from a simple interface.

Real-time intent data empowers brands to make important business policy, process, and product related decisions, and to automate a high percentage of consumer interactions when used in conjunction with LivePerson’s Conversation Builder.
