Conversational commerce makes it easy for people to communicate with brands to ask questions, make purchases, and get help using their preferred messaging channel. Using conversational commerce, brands can shift customer interaction volume from expensive, unsatisfactory voice and web channels to conversational interfaces meeting consumers where they’re already comfortable, and driving huge efficiencies and customer satisfaction.

LivePerson brings to the table a first-to-market AI-powered conversational platform that works with brands to connect with consumers in their preferred conversational channel and scale to any number of conversations - the Conversational Cloud. Brands can use the Conversational Cloud to discover and understand consumer intents, design and scale automations to fulfill those intents, and measure and optimize the effectiveness of conversations.

## How the Conversation Cloud Works

The Conversational Cloud is both channel-agnostic and AI-powered, with all its AI components working together to help brands become conversational. In real time, the Conversational Cloud allows brands to understand consumer intent, route consumers to the right agent (bot or human), manage agent workload, queue consumers, and uncover trending topics. The platform’s AI components consist of: 
* Intent Manager - with Intent Builder and Analyzer
* Conversation Builder - with a Knowledge Base and Agent Assist
* Conversation Manager
* Conversation Orchestrator - with Dynamic Routing
* Conversation Analytics
