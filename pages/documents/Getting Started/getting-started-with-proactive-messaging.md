## What is Proactive Messaging?
LivePersonâ€™s Proactive Messaging feature allows brands to engage in two-way conversations with their consumers by creating targeted outbound campaigns using rich channels. Consumer responses are routed into the Agent Workspace, where conversations can be handled by humans, automation, or a tango of both. This enables brands to increase their ability to connect with a targeted consumer base, with a higher probability of achieving goals, and a richer, more personalized consumer experience.
