The account number (aka Account ID) is your primary identifier in the Conversational Cloud. It is one of the three mandatory fields you must complete to successfully login to your Conversational Cloud account, and should therefore be stored somewhere safe.

## How to find your account number:

**1. If you're the account owner**  
When you first registered and your account was created, you should have received a registration email from LivePerson containing your account number. Search both your mailbox and your Spam folder for an email from registration@liveperson.com.

**2. If youâ€™re not the account owner**  
If no one at your company is able to provide you with your Conversational Cloud account number, and/or in case of an emergency, follow the steps in the video below in order to obtain the Conversational Cloud account number for your brand.
