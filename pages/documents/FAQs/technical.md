## Functionality

### How is the LiveEngage solution deployed on my website?

To deploy the LiveEngage solution on your website, copy and paste the LiveEngage Tag into your web pages. Once the LiveEngage Tag is placed on as many pages as possible, you will be able to monitor your visitors and connect with them based on their real time behavior. For further information, watch the video [Placing the LiveEngage Tag on Your Website](https://liveengage.liveperson.net/a/new/?connectionOpenArticle=placing-the-liveengage).

### What information about the visitor is available?

LiveEngage presents detailed information about the journey of each visitor in the Agent Workspace. This includes: specific pages visited, length of time spent on the pages, total length of session time, date of last visit, visitor browser type, visitor device type, geographical location, and IP address.

LiveEngage also enables you to extract more detailed and specific information about your visitors. Using Engagement Attributes, you can extract information such as cart total, marketing channel source, transaction order ID and lead details.

For more information on the tracking capabilities of LiveEngage, read the article on how to [Collect Valuable Customer Information]().

### What are campaigns?

Campaigns are essential for working with LiveEngage. Campaigns serve as a container in which several aspects of your online marketing efforts are included.

They allow you to configure several key elements, such as targeting a specific audience. They also allow you to decide where to put your engagements on your website, and to customize how your engagements appear. Campaigns are focused on business goals which help you measure the success and progress of your campaigns. The following items are included in
campaigns:

- What you want to achieve. (Goal)
- The visitors you specifically want to target. (Target audience)
- How you want to interact with your visitors. (Engagements)
- The optimum place(s) on your website where you want to interact with visitors.
(Location)
- The browsing behavior of visitors which is of interest to you. (Visitor behavior)

### How are campaigns added?
Campaigns are added through the Campaigns area of the LiveEngage Platform. For information on creating campaigns, watch the [LiveEngage Campaigns Tutorial]().

### How many campaigns can be created?

You can create as many campaigns as you need, according to your business goals. Under each campaign you can create as many different engagements (such as invitations to chat, or content banners) as you require in order to meet these goals. For further information on how campaigns work, and setting them up, watch the video on how to [Achieve Your Business Goals with LiveEngage Campaigns]().

### How do I route chats to the correct agent?

Chats can be routed to skill groups based on: the skill of the chat, the properties of the consumer, the page that the chat originated on, or campaigns that you created. LiveEngage offers two routing options: chats are routed to any online agent with the relevant skills, or chats are routed via a built-in Automatic Chat Distribution (ACD) algorithm.

ACD helps balance the workload among all available agents, ensuring optimal agent efficiency. Chats are routed to agents based on how many chats the agent is allowed to take (maximum concurrency), and how many chats the agent is currently handling.

### Can different agents be set up to take different numbers of chats?

Agents can be set to take a maximum number of concurrent chats on an agent-by-agent basis, e.g. new agents may be set to take a lower number of concurrent chats than more experienced agents. There is no technical limitation to the number of concurrent chats an agent can take. The maximum number of concurrent chats per agent is configurable in the Users area of the LiveEngage Platform. For further information, watch the video on [Handling Chats in the Agent Workspace]().

### What reports are available?

LiveEngage reports present meaningful and useful information in real time, helping you make better business decisions. Our reports are contextual to persona, and fully integrated into the LiveEngage platform. The reports include information on Chat Operations, Conversion (Sales), Campaigns and Traffic, along with a chat transcript database.

There are two kinds of dashboards. Campaign-level dashboards show you how your engagements are affecting your business (and its success), while operational data dashboards clue you in to how your CCPs (agents) are doing and provide key operational metrics to any sized business.

The real-time [Agent Data Bar and Dashboard]() provide a graphic display of in-depth data to help agents monitor their performance and take any necessary actions. Agent managers are presented with a [detailed analysis of agent activity and efficiency](), while campaign managers can evaluate campaign effectiveness, identify success factors, and take strategic business decisions.

Comprehensive, real-time [BI-Dashboards]() provide additional information for agent managers and campaign managers.

LiveEngage also provides a billing dashboard with information on credit usage and utilization. You can optimize your billing plan by making your selection based on your business needs and actual usage.

### How do I track customer history?

Customer history is tracked using cookies. These cookies provide LiveEngage with the customer’s unique ID, last visit date, and last chat date. Using this unique ID, LiveEngage can retrieve all past chat transcripts. Contact LivePerson for detailed information on how LiveEngage uses cookies.

### What aspects of customer history are tracked?

LiveEngage tracks the entire chat transcript, name (if submitted by the visitor), IP address, browser and computer configuration information, and any custom data associated with the visitor’s session. All of these are searchable and available through the Engagement History engine. All survey answers attributed to a chat session are tracked. All browsed pages are listed, providing that the LiveEngage Tag is added to those pages.

### For how long are the chat transcripts stored?

Transcript data is stored for 13 months. During this time, the transcripts can be accessed through the Agent Workspace. There is also an option to download the transcripts to XML format. After 13 months, transcripts are purged from the database.

## Platform

### Is the communication secure?

LivePerson provides secure communication between the visitor and the agent. All chat interactions take place over https using 128-bit TLS encryption.

### Which security programs is LiveEngage compliant with?

LiveEngage is compliant with the following programs:

- SSAE 16 SOC2 (Formerly SAS70)
- ISO 27001
- PCI DSS 3.0
- Safe Harbor
- SOX
- HIPAA Through the Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
- SkyHigh Enterprise Ready

### What happens to my site if LiveEngage is down?

If the LiveEngage application servers are down, this will have no effect on the experience of the visitors on your website.

### How large are the tags?

The tag which you copy onto your web pages is less than 1 kilobyte in size. When downloaded, the core tag is approximately 10 kilobytes zipped.

Note: Using additional features may increase the size of the tag. For further information, contact LivePerson.

### What are the performance implications of having the LiveEngage Tag on my pages?

As the LiveEngage Tag deployed on your page is under 1 kilobyte in size, the performance implications on your website are negligible. The dynamic content is downloaded using asynchronous technology and techniques, and therefore has no impact on the visitor experience of the website.

Note: Some of the page load tracking solutions mistakenly treat our loading as part of the page load process, due to the fact that those tools do not distinguish between synchronous / blocking and asynchronous loading techniques.

### Do my agents need to have software on their computers?

No installation or plug-ins are required as the LiveEngage Platform is HTML/JavaScript-based.

### What are the supported Operating Systems and Browsers?

For the most up-to-date information on supported Operating Systems and Browsers, refer to [LiveEngage System Requirements]().

### How do I add more agent logins?

LivePerson follows a Cost per Interaction model, meaning that customers pay per number of interactions, rather than per number of agents or features. There is no limit to the number of agents that can be used, and all features are built-in and included within the platform.

### Do visitors need to install any software or plug-in to interact with me on my website or mobile sites?

No installation or plug-in is needed, as LiveEngage is HTML/JavaScript-based. All of your visitors who are using one of the support browsers with JavaScript enabled will be able to chat with you or request a call. There is no need for the visitor to download or install anything.

The new LivePerson Embedded Engagement Window provides a consistent connected experience for your customers. It helps you maintain brand consistency through a unified look and feel across desktop and mobile devices. It also enables your visitors to multi-task; they can chat while navigating a website. Lastly, there is less chance visitors will get lost, as they remain in the same browser window while they chat with you.

## Mobile Web

### What do I have to do to have chat or content for visitors coming from mobile web?

Nothing! The LE Embedded Engagement Window comes with out-of-the-box support for mobile web.

### How can I get the window to be embedded on the website?

For the window to be embedded on the page on mobile web, you need to add the viewport meta tag to the header of all your site pages. This is the recommended content: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"/>`

You can set the `content` as you wish, as long as you have `width=device-width`.

If the viewport does not exist on the page, or the width is set to any other value, the visitor will still be able to chat, but the chat window will open on a different tab.

### What browsers and operating systems are supported for mobile web?

Refer to [LiveEngage System Requirements]() for information on supported browsers and operating systems.

### What window features are supported on mobile web?

All desktop features are also supported on mobile web, including: Navigating while chatting, i18n support, window branding and configuration, and more.

### Do I need to create a new campaign for mobile web?

This is up to you. You can use the same campaign for mobile web and desktop web, or you can create separate campaigns according to whether the target audience platform is mobile or desktop.

### What experience will tablet visitors get?

The tablet experience is the same as the mobile experience. This is because in tablet, the keyboard that is opened covers about half of the screen. So as to make sure we deliver a great experience, the tablet window takes up the full screen as in mobile (if the window was embedded as in desktop, it would be covered by the keyboard).
