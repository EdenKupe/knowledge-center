## How do I connect an HTML button?

Ensure the HTML code that gets injected on the web page is actually valid HTML before checking other potentially non-config issues. It is convenient to use an HTML editor in order to check whether the HTML snippet is valid or not - https://www.w3schools.com/tryit/default.asp
Note: you might want to check Entry points (e.g. sections) and other engagement configurations, which should also be reflected on the customer's web page (e.g. sections need to be pushed on the page)
There is an embedded WhatsApp button configuration guide, which allows the client to insert a WhatsApp reference link on a web page, which points to an API endpoint and if the consumer is browsing through mobile - it will prompt the consumer to switch to the WA app and start Chatting with the client's phone number.
