Enhanced by automation and featuring an upgraded design, the agent workspace has been updated to boost agent efficiency and improve the productivity of messaging operations. The new design caters specifically to the unique demands of messaging, featuring self-serve capabilities and utilizing automatic algorithms on the backend to dynamically prioritize conversations for the agent. This new dynamic list allows agents to work more intuitively, saving precious time and removing the need for guesswork.

## What’s new?

The main enhancements to the agent workspace include:

* **Dynamic conversation list**: Built-in automation sorts conversations by SLA for the agent, saving them valuable time by calculating variables, including SLAs and consumer replies, and focusing agents’ attention.

* **Recommendation of next conversation to answer**: Built-in automation tells agents which conversation to answer next, removing the need for decision making that can be time consuming and prone to human error.

* **Recommended next action (coming September)**: Recommended actions powered by Maven are interwoven into the conversation within the newly designed workspace. Recommended actions include adding a bot to the conversation, recommending a Knowledge Center article, and suggesting the next response.

* **New idle filter** :The addition of the new ‘idle’ status filter allows agents to determine which conversations have been pending a consumer response for over five minutes.

* **Enhanced conversation summary**: The conversation summary widget has been enhanced to support the entering of multiple notes by several agents, allowing them to see a log of comments for context.

* **History in transcript**: The conversation history now appears directly in the transcript so that it can be easily accessed, rather than in a dedicated widget.

* Closed conversations
