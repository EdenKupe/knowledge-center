Brands can configure the following aspects of the agent experience.

## Configuration from your LivePerson workspace

### Auto accept

Determine if incoming conversations will automatically enter an agents workspace or if they have to press ’accept’ button to receive them.

Set up: 
1. Login to LivePerson as an admin and access the Night Vision settings by clicking on the Night Vision icon to the top right of the screen.
2. Select ‘auto accept’ or ‘advanced’ mode.

## Additional custom configuration options 

Contact your LivePerson representative to customize the following parameters per your requirements.

### Timeframe for closed conversations 
In the workspace, agents can use the filter in their conversation list to view only ‘closed’ conversations.  This setting will determine the time frame to display the closed conversations, or how far back to display conversations.  

Default: 2 days

Min: 1 day

Max: 14 days

### Time format
Determine the format of the time that is displayed to agents within the workspace and within conversations.

Default: 12 hour clock (e.g. 08:59pm)

Option: 24 hour clock (e.g.  = 20:59)

### Disable emojis
Brands can elect to remove the option for agents to send emojis during a conversation. 

Default: emojis are enabled 

### Hide unauthenticated consumer attributes
The ‘consumer info’ widget displayed consumer attributes to the agents.  This setting enables brands to hide any unauthenticated attributes from the agents.
