The agent workspace is tailored to the needs of messaging agents and was designed using feedback and requests from hundreds of messaging agents. It is developed for an easy plug-and-play approach and requires little to no configuration.  

There are a few configurations that brands can elect to control for the agent experience as outlined below.
