## Dynamic conversation list

[GIF of list]

Add an ‘always answer the ones on top’ and when you do it will drop down, brining the next conversation you should answer to the top

All conversations that were assigned to you or that you are participating in will appear in your workspace. The new dynamic conversation list utilizes automation to stay continually updated and prioritize the most urgent conversations. This allows agents to efficiently work through the conversation list from top to bottom, rather than manually determining which conversations to prioritize. This list is comprehensive, including ongoing, overdue, idle, and closed conversations that are filterable by status.

Clicking on each conversation will allow you to read the transcript, browse different widgets and start engaging with your customers. If you choose to click on a consumer’s name, it will open up the entire conversation and you can begin messaging.

## Status filters

Agents can filter conversations in the list by the following statuses:

* **Ongoing**

    * *Definition*: Ongoing conversations are conversations that are currently active and being handled by the agent.

    * *How to use*: During a daily shift, use this filter to display the conversations you should be handling.

* **Overdue**

    * *Definition*: Conversations that have not been answered before the SLA has expired.  Each brand can define how quickly they want to commit to a reply (SLA).  

    * *How to use*: Ensure these conversations are always showing during your shift to ensure your KPIs are met.

* **Idle**

    * *Definition*: These are conversations that are pending a consumer response for over 5 minutes and do not require an active response from the agent.

    * *How to use*: filter these conversations OUT in order to have a focused and succinct list of conversations that you should focus on.  This filter will help you to keep a close eye on all your active conversations and focus your energies where most needed.

* **Closed**

    * *Definition*: Conversations that have been marked as ‘closed’ by you, by consumers, or automatically closed by the system due to timeout.

    * *How to use*: filter these conversations at the end of your shift, or if you have down time.  This will help you to review that you have taken all the necessary wrap up steps and documentation for each one.  You can also use this filter if you are planning to proactively follow up with conversations.

## Your personal data bar

As you go about your shift, your own agent data bar will display on the top of your workspace and will update immediately. This will help you keep track of your performance as well as expected workload. The data bar in the agent workspace represents the real-time tracking of your current workload and shift.

The data bar in your workspace will represent the queue data that is relevant only to you and your conversations for the current shift. Here you will see real-time data tracking the following:

**OPEN:** number of current open conversations

**PENDING:** number of conversations pending agent response

**OVERDUE:** number of conversations that exceeded the target response time

**SOON TO BE OVERDUE:** number of conversations about to exceed the target response time in 5 minutes

**ACTIONABLE:** number of conversations that are waiting to be assigned to an agent in the queue and have an immediate action (e.g. reply to a waiting customer)

**IN QUEUE:** overall number of conversations in the queue, including actionable and not actionable. A not actionable conversation is one that is still open but awaiting a consumer reply. Only the actionable conversations are routed to agents

**CSAT:** displays the [customer satisfaction score](http://oavrxoiy0ht8aq.instant.forestry.io/contact-center-management-messaging-operations-benchmarks-to-measure-messaging-success.html#2-customer-satisfaction-score-csat), based on the post conversation surveys that were completed in the last 12 hours.
