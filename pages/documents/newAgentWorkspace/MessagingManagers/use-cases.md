The new manager workspace was designed to increase managers’ impact on their agents and overall shift performance. It provides a centralized location within LiveEngage to give you the visibility and actionable insights needed to achieve your KPIs. 

The manager workspace gives you the ability to assess the shift status at a higher level and identify queue health issues at a glance. Additional details per agent and per conversation allow for further analysis and tracking.

## 1. Understand and take action on spikes in queue length

Keep agents focused by tracking the in-queue metrics and identifying the cause of a spike.

If you notice that the number of conversations in the queue has become too high, you can take action by filtering to see “Away” agents and identify agents that are not on schedule.

Choose an action such as “ask them to adhere to schedule” to resolve the spike in queue length and keep agents on target. 

## 2. Monitor closed conversations

Ensure operations are running smoothly and keep an eye on the number of closed conversations with the activity summary at the top right.

If the number of closed conversations appears too low, you can locate agents with a high number of assigned conversations but a low number of active conversations.

You can then review the agent’s inactive conversations and determine whether they should have been closed.

## 3. Maintain a high CSAT through real-time monitoring

Oversee and address customer satisfaction issues by monitoring the score in real time in the activity summary.

If you notice the CSAT score is low, you can identify the issue by using the filters to sort conversations by CSAT.

You can then review the conversations with low CSAT scores to determine what went wrong and discuss it with the agent.
