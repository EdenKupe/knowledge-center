For the September rollout, the only change for chat users will be to the navigation bar. The side navigation has been updated with new icons, and the agent status menu has been moved to the bottom left corner.

{: .notice}
**Please note:** The enhanced UI will be available from September 16th and will appear by default to all users. There is **not** an option to revert it.

## Blended accounts

For brands that have live chat agents accepting messaging conversations as well - please note that the workspaces will now be seperate. Agents who handle chat conversations as well as messaging will need to continue working from the existing workspace. It is possible to have agents with separate logins handling both messaging and chat conversations in separate shifts.
