<div class="contentTitle"><img class="titleimage" src="img/all-live-chat.svg" /><h3>For all live chat users</h3></div>
<span class="contentRowText">

For brands that have not yet upgraded to asynchronous messaging, the effect of the new experiences will be nominal.
<br>
<br>
All live chat users will continue to use the same tools and workspaces.
<br>
<br>
The only change is the new navigation that will appear to all users.
<br>
<br>
New design for the navigation bar will introduce new icons.
<br>
<br>
New icon and new location to access the ‘‘user menu’ where agents change their online and away statuses.

<br>
For brands that have live chat agents accepting messaging conversations as well - please note that the workspaces will now be seperate. Agents who handle chat conversations as well as messaging will need to continue working from the existing workspace. It is possible to have agents with separate logins handling both messaging and chat conversations in separate shifts.
