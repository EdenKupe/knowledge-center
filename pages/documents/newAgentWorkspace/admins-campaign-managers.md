For the September rollout, the only change for admin and campaign manager roles will be to the navigation bar, which has been updated with new icons. In the near future all tools for these users will also adopt the enhanced UI.

{: .notice}
**Please note:** The enhanced UI will be available from September 16th and will appear by default to all users. There is **not** an option to revert it.

## Navigation bar

Admins and campaign managers have the new navigation with updated side bar icons.

## Launchpad

Launchpad is a post-login administrator hub that presents users and admins with quick access to all of the services in the LivePerson ecosystem. From Launchpad, admins will be able to quickly access all their favorite LivePerson tools from one place, plus discover and learn more about tools they’re not using yet.

In late September, we’ll be kicking off an Early Access program for the Launchpad. Please contact Eran Naot to join the Early Access Program or  for more information.
