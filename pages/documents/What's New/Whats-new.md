Here is a round-up of the latest features, enhancements and enablements that are coming in March 2019 - all designed to help you make even more meaningful connections. We hope you enjoy using them!

## Configuring Welcome Message using Quick Replies

Allows brands to send the first message (after a consumer has opened conversation window) with a list of quick replies of common intents to be addressed over messaging.

The quick replies run through a bot flow, allowing the bot to respond with relevant and accurate answers to the consumer. This feature only applies to Web Messaging.

## Photo sharing - agent to consumer (web messaging)

Agents and bots can send photos to consumers to explain issues or requests quicker and more accurately. For example, a screenshot for tech support, or a product photo making messaging conversations a more visual experience and reduce time to resolution. All photos will appear in conversation transcripts.

## Transfer to agent

Increase customer satisfaction by enabling agent-to-agent transfer. This gives agents, agent managers and bots the ability to transfer a conversation not just to a skill, but to a specific agent with expertise on the subject, or an agent that has previously been involved in the case.

## Auto close per skill

The pace of conversations can vary across different skills. LivePerson’s auto close now has a ‘per skill level’ (in addition to account level configuration) to finetune when a conversation closes per skill - improving agent efficiency and operations. For example, brands may want to keep a sales-related conversation open for longer than a standard support request.

## Report Builder - Export-ready grids

To assist brands with the adoption of Report Builder, LivePerson is offering predefined documents intended for easy download and email subscription. The content of these documents replace the grids that are available in the Operational BI. The following reports will be created as standalone documents and can be found in My Reports in the Report Builder.

* Agent Activity Grid - Daily & Monthly
* Skill Activity Grid - Daily & Monthly
* Survey Activity Grid - Daily & Monthly
* Goal Tracker Grid

## Smart Capacity Metrics

The Advanced Messaging dashboard in the Report Builder has been enriched with smart capacity metrics to indicate whether you are over or under-staffed enabling and assessment of whether your contact center is being optimized.

Metrics for staffing analysis:

* Available conversations slots ratio - indicates overstaffing
* Avg. Time to Assignment - indicates understaffing

Metrics for measuring the impact of Smart Capacity and agents' performance:

* Time to response & TTFR while fully loaded
* Idle time while fully loaded.

For all the features listed above please check the weekly release notes for exact rollout dates as delivery dates may vary and are subject to change.
