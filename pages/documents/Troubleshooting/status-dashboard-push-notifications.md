As part of our continued effort to enhance our customers’ experiences and increase transparency, we are adding a new capability to the [LivePerson Status Dashboard](https://status.liveperson.com). This capability will allow you to receive proactive SMS and email alerts for major incidents in real-time. 

We have added this capability following direct feedback from customers who asked for proactive alerts for major incidents and found the previous subscription option difficult to operate. With the new solution, users can subscribe to SMS and email alerts, and from that moment onwards all notifications related to their account will be sent without the need to re-subscribe.

**In this guide, you’ll learn about:**
* Registering for Status Dashboard push notifications 
* New major incident notifications
* Update notifications during major incidents
* Resolution notifications
* Incident canceled notifications 
* Scope removed notifications
