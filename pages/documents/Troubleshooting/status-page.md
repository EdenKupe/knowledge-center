The status page is a communication tool that helps us inform you about outages and scheduled maintenance. It is located in the LiveEngage platform.

You can view the status page by clicking on the agent avatar and then click on the service status dashboard.

## Service status page dashboard

The status page dashboard is easy to use and shows the current status of each service. At the bottom of the dashboard there is a glossary showing the various statuses.

In the case of a ‘Service interruption’ for example, you can click on the exclamation mark to view the full details of the incident.
Once you enter the status page, there will be a full view of the current statuses and future maintenance activities.
