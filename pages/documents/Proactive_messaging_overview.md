Proactive Messaging is currently available as part of an early adopter program. To join this program, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/wDBkzsCtT4CCQMFR9).

Business SMS is an effective communication tool, but until now has only been one-way. Many brands effectively utilize proactive messaging to send account service or sales related information. However, this communication is one-way, leading to several missed opportunities in customer replies.

With LivePerson’s Proactive Messaging, brands can now send consumers outbound messages on channels like SMS, WhatsApp to initiate high value marketing and customer care conversations. Instead of relying on low conversion emails, or one-way messages that drive consumers to web pages or phone calls, Proactive Messaging allows consumers to respond to marketing campaigns and customer care alerts within the same conversation. This results in higher conversion rates, fewer calls and operational costs, and rich messaging experiences that increase consumer satisfaction.

This new capability enables brands to build relationships and engage with their consumers by giving them the ability to both respond to consumers who reach out and also proactively share value-added information with their consumers, when applicable. Brands can leverage LiveEngage to generate leads for their conversational commerce scenarios by sharing important and timely information such as reminders about bill payments, subscriptions renewal, feedback requests, new deals, or updates on product availability.

## Benefits of using Proactive Messaging

### Create conversations, not spam (Marketing)

Consumers overwhelmingly prefer messaging conversations to phone or email, and consumers that engage in messaging conversations are 3x more likely to make a purchase than those who don’t. Our two-way Proactive Messaging platform makes it easy to engage consumers with targeted campaigns, then respond to questions and sales inquiries in the same convenient conversation.

### Deliver better care at lower costs (Customer Care)

Don’t make your consumers call and wait on hold to get support or information. Use Proactive Messaging to start conversations on topics like account updates or service outages to reduce inbound call and email volume and increase consumer satisfaction.

### One platform for every channel and conversation (Single Platform)

LiveEngage is the industry’s leading conversation management platform. It offers a single place to manage inbound and outbound messages from every channel, and layers in powerful chatbots for better consumer experiences and lower operational costs. LiveEngage connects to back-end systems like CRMs, so that brands can easily manage marketing, sales, and customer care KPIs for proactive campaigns while getting a complete view of the entire consumer journey.
