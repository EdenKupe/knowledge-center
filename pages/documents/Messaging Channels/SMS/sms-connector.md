The addition of SMS to LiveEngage operations, creates another gateway for messaging between brands and consumers. Brands can tap into the wide pool of consumers who prefer to use SMS as a form of communication and want to text with brands just like they would their friends and family.

## Why use SMS to connect with your consumers?

* **Channel of choice** — SMS is the most commonly used app for mobile consumers, and is available natively on all mobile phones.
* **Lower costs** — There is no custom development and conversations cost less than a phone call.
* **Easy setup** — Onboarding can be accomplished rapidly as no tagging or coding is required and LiveEngage connects SMS texts directly to your operations, routing each customer to the best agent available.
* **No download required** — Because consumers already have SMS on their mobiles, no new customer interface or download is needed.
* **Rich Messaging capabilities** — Rich Messaging capabilities like image sharing provide an enhanced messaging experience with more flexibility.

## How conversations start

**Brands and consumers can begin interacting over SMS through multiple entry points, here are are some of the ways conversations can start:**

* **Reduce the queue with IVR deflection:** Get customers off hold faster with the option of exiting the line and continuing the conversation over text, or automatically send a text message as an alternative for people who have dialed.
* **Keep in touch after phone support:** Empower agents to send follow-up items such as service follow-ups, upgrades and personalized offers, to keep the conversation going and drive usage.
* **Turn automation into conversation:** Allow customers to respond to automated texts, like account updates or appointment reminders, and begin a conversation with an agent.
* **Add two-way communication to any ad:** Add text to existing ads, whether digital, print or even radio. By providing a quick and instant way for consumers to get in touch, the impact of promotions and other engagements will surge.
