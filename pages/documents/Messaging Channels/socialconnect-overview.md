SocialConnect enables brands to interact with consumers over Twitter and Facebook through LiveEngage. For each new channel, conversations can take place both in public (Twitter Tweet that mention the brand and Facebook Page posts and comments), in private (Twitter DMs and Facebook Messenger), or a mix of public and private message in the same conversation.  

This new functionality is built on top of the LiveEngage platform so all existing messaging functionality will work out of the box.  In addition to enabling new communication channels, SocialConnect will add:
* A new agent widget (Social Widget) to provide additional context and functionality
* A separate UI for system and channel configuration
