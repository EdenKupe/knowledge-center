## Introducing Connect to Messaging

LivePerson Connect to Messaging (C2M) is an IVR deflection solution that lets brands move voice calls to messaging through the Conversational Cloud platform. Once consumers opt to deflect to a messaging conversation, they will receive an outbound message over SMS, WhatsApp or App Messaging, which will allow them to respond and start messaging with the brand. The consumer responses are routed into the Conversational Cloud’s Agent Workspace, where conversations can be handled by human agents, automation, or a mix of both. This service enables a richer and more personalized consumer experience, while utilizing all Conversational Cloud capabilities. SMS, WhatsApp and App Messaging are the supported messaging channels, with more  messaging options coming in the near future.

### Consumer benefits of using C2M

* **Eliminate call waiting:** People on average end up spending 10-45 minutes tied up on calls during business hours. Messaging is much quicker and allows consumers to talk when it’s convenient for them. 
* **Continuous conversation history:** With voice calls, the consumer needs to remember previous calls, take down all the notes and repeat to call back again. Messaging allows them to view previous conversations. 
* **Easy to reach different services:**  Consumers can call one customer service number to route voice calls to various agent skills for a better consumer experience.

### Brand benefits of using C2M

* **Reach consumers through popular channels:** Brands can offer multiple deflection messaging channels to their consumers, allowing them to interact through WhatsApp, SMS, and App Messaging.
* **Handle conversations in one place:** Brands have a single view to the contact center operations with unified messaging operations and analytics for all consumer channels.
* **Build an ongoing relationship with consumers:** Brands can personalize the first outbound message sent to the consumers, this will improve better response rate and create conversations. 
* **Improve consumer experience:** This service routes the consumer’s message to the right agent skill, removing the need for multiple transfers across agents. This will drive better care and reduce operational costs.
