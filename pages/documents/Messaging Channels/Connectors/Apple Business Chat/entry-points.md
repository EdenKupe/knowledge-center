Once registered for Apple Business Chat, the business will have an option to enable the following entry points: 
* Business Chat Conversation URL 
  * When customers click the conversation URL, the system redirects them to the Message app where they can send a message to your business. 
  * The conversation link can be used in email, social media, QR codes, and as website buttons and app engagement.  
* Chat Suggest
* Maps and Siri 

## Apple Business Chat Conversation URL

The conversation URL consists of a business ID and optional query string parameters that are invaluable to optimizing Business Chat entry points and tracking traffic. 

As an overview, the conversation URL is **https://bcrw.apple.com/urn:biz:<your-business-id>**, replacing **<your-business-id>** with the business ID you received from Apple after registering with Business Chat. For example:
