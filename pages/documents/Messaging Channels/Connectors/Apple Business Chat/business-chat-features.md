## List Picker

List Picker is a simple Business Chat UI component that makes it easy to display a list of items and have the user make a selection from the list. It is set up in Conversational Cloud using [structured content](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/messaging-channels-rich-conversations-structured-content-for-messaging-user-guide.html)-- which supports a variety of messaging interactions to enable enhanced and clearer communication-- and is able to be sent either by a human or automated agent. Structured content plays a vital role in ich Messaging and allows brands to encourage customer action directly within the conversation. The List Picker serves different purposes and can be configured to be **static** or **dynamic**, depending on the use case. The use of List Pickers is highly recommended in Apple Business Chat configuration to provide customers a quick way to tap to make choices, rather than typing.  It also helps create the level of richness that meets Apple’s standards. 

### Static List Pickers

A Static List Picker is a simple configuration that offers the same choice to all customers entering a conversation. They are most useful for simple routing, such as query type and CSAT rating. For static pickers, bots or agents have a simple set of predefined lists that can be sent out at the start of or during the conversation. Static pickers require low configuration effort by either the business or LivePerson resources.  

### Static List Picker for skill routing

The most basic and ubiquitous use of a List Picker is in collecting customer intent and routing the conversation to the appropriate skills. The Routing List Picker makes it easy for customers to express their intent and for the agent to quickly recognize the customer’s needs. In doing this, we encourage brands to analyze the top reasons why customers contact their business. These contact drivers should then inform the key intents to be included in the Routing List Picker. Below is an example of this simple List Picker interaction.

### Dynamic List Pickers

Dynamic pickers add value and can help to reduce handle times by allowing agents to easily find and present relevant choices to the consumer. Their configuration, however, requires a heavier lift with integration to the brand’s backend system. Dynamic List Pickers pull a list of items from a brand’s back-end data source or API. It can be served to the customer in two ways: (1) automatically, based on the context of the conversation or (2) manually, with an agent physically searching for items to add to the picker in an agent widget.
