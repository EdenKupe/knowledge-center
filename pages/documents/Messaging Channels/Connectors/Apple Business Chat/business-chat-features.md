## List Picker

List Picker is a simple Business Chat UI component that makes it easy to display a list of items and have the user make a selection from the list. It is set up in Conversational Cloud using [structured content](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/messaging-channels-rich-conversations-structured-content-for-messaging-user-guide.html)-- which supports a variety of messaging interactions to enable enhanced and clearer communication-- and is able to be sent either by a human or automated agent. Structured content plays a vital role in ich Messaging and allows brands to encourage customer action directly within the conversation. The List Picker serves different purposes and can be configured to be **static** or **dynamic**, depending on the use case. The use of List Pickers is highly recommended in Apple Business Chat configuration to provide customers a quick way to tap to make choices, rather than typing.  It also helps create the level of richness that meets Appleâ€™s standards.
