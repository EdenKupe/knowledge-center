## Apple Business Chat Overview

Apple Business Chat enables brands to help customers resolve issues, schedule appointments, and make purchases or payments all within the Message app.  Brands can leverage the rich features of Apple’s platforms to provide an integrated messaging experience that is branded, verified, encrypted and delightful. LivePerson has enabled hundreds of brands with Business Chat, helping them to easily connect with their customers. Business Chat is supported by Apple devices running on iOS 11.3 and later or macOS 10.13.4 and later.


## Benefits of Apple Business Chat

* **Expand your consumer reach** - As of January 2020, Apple hit **1.5 billion** active devices with ~80% of recent iPhones and iPads running iOS 14+. You can expand into a massive base of iOS users to offer true service and transactional use cases with a ‘Tango’ between automation and human agents. 

* **Easy to connect, always in touch** - Easy to start from a wide range of entry points and continue on the customer’s time across commerce and service flows. 

* **Secure messaging** - Apple’s strictly enforced Brand verification ensures consumer confidence and their rich, secure, interactive messaging capabilities drive optimal experience. 

* **No Gateway Fees** - Reduce costs by eliminating carrier gateway fees - Apple does not charge gateway or transaction fees for Business Chat messages.

* **Rich Experiences** - With interactive messages, customers can communicate with brands in dynamic, visual ways within the Message app.

  * Interactive capabilities native to iOS include Apple Pay for payments, iMessage apps to display business app features within the conversation, pickers to prompt customers to choose an item or timeslot, etc. 
  * LivePerson solutions can also be leveraged such as automatic messages, secure forms, post conversation surveys and file/ image/ audio sharing. 


## How conversations start: Entry Points

Consumers can start a conversation with brands through Business Chat buttons. These  buttons can be enabled in places where customers might want to contact your business. Additionally, brands can also set up Chat Suggest to further deflect calls and reduce voice support.
