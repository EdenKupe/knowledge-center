## Introduction

Apple Business Chat enables brands to help customers resolve issues, schedule appointments, and make purchases or payments all within the Message app.  Brands can leverage the full iMessage framework to provide an integrated messaging experience that is branded, verified, encrypted and delightful. As Apple Business Chat’s premier partner, LivePerson has enabled +120 brands with Business Chat, helping them to easily connect with their customers.


## Benefits of Apple Business Chat

* **Expand your consumer reach** - As of January 2020, Apple hit **1.5 billion** active devices with ~80% of recent iPhones and iPads running iOS 13+. You can expand into a massive base of iOS users to offer true service and transactional use cases with a ‘Tango’ between automation and Live Agents.

* **Easy to connect, always in touch** - Easy to start from a wide range of entry points and continue on the customer’s time across commerce and service flows. 

* **Secure messaging** - Apple’s strictly enforced Brand verification ensures consumer confidence and their rich, secure, interactive messaging capabilities drive optimal experience. 

* **No Gateway Fees** - Reduce costs by eliminating carrier gateway fees - Apple does not charge gateway or transaction fees for Business Chat messages.

* **Rich Experiences** - With interactive messages, customers can communicate with brands in dynamic, visual ways within the Message app.

  * Interactive capabilities native to iOS include Apple Pay for payments, iMessage apps to display business app features within the conversation, pickers to prompt customers to choose an item or timeslot, etc. 
  * LivePerson solutions can also be leveraged such as automatic messages, secure forms, post conversation surveys and file/ image/ audio sharing. 


## How conversations start: Entry Points

Consumers can start a conversation with brands through business chat buttons. These  buttons can be enabled in places where customers might want to contact your business. Additionally, brands can also set up Chat Suggest, to further deflect calls and reduce voice support. 

### Chat Suggest
<img src="img/abc-davids-chat-suggest.png" style="float:right;width:240px;margin:0 0 10px 20px">
When your customers tap on any of your registered business phone numbers, a phone sheet appears allowing your customers to choose between voice and messaging.

  **By enabling Chat Suggest, you can:**
  * Provide the most flexibility and controllability of incoming traffic by allowing brands to quickly throttle the feature’s visibility
  * Deflect calls before your customers  reach your IVR queue 
  * Reduce voice support costs by shifting call volume to messaging 
  * Provide better customer experience with business chat’s built-in features, such as Apple Pay, list pickers, time pickers, and Augmented Reality 

  **Overall setup effort: Low** 

  **Dependencies:** Businesses must either have an existing business chat program OR launch with at least an MVP business chat configuration.

  **Setup:** Once a brand has identified the phone numbers to enable for business chat, they are required to complete a chat suggest form to be sent to Apple. 

  **Note:** Chat Suggest has a 7-10 day ramp up period, which is the timeframe for the feature to propagate across all iOS devices with iOS 13+.
