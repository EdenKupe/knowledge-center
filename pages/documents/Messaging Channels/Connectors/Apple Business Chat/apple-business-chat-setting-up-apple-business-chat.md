## Business Chat Readiness

To get started with Apple Business Chat, we encourage you to assess if this is the correct solution for your business. The following **business chat readiness review** is a quick questionnaire that you can submit to LivePerson and Apple teams to help you determine if business chat is the right solution for your digital transformation and operational goals. 

## Business Chat Setup Process
### Account Registration
The first step in onboarding your business is to ensure you and your team members have an Apple ID using your organization’s email address. You will need this to create the business chat account and for testing purposes. 

1. **Onboarding.** Start in Data Sources of your Conversational Cloud account to complete the onboarding form for Apple Business Chat.  

1. **Create an Apple ID.** You will need an Apple ID using your organization’s email address in order to administer Business Chat and accept Apple’s Terms of Use. You can create your Apple ID [here](https://appleid.apple.com/account#!&page=create).

1. **Register Business profile.** Sign into [Apple Register](https://register.apple.com/) and select ‘Business Chat Accounts’ in the service menu. You must add your business information in required fields to  complete your ‘Organization’ profile. 

1. **Add team members.** To help administer your Apple profile, it is recommended that you designate ‘Administration’ roles to additional members of your organization and to LivePerson’s Apple Business Chat team, who will continue and monitor the business chat registration process for your organization.  

### What's Next

The onboarding process includes an Apple review in different points within the journey. Apple reviews your application and an email notification is sent to you with approval. 

The onboarding form from Data Sources serves to both create a business chat account for your business and to automate the minimum viable experience allowed by Apple.   

### Note

Business Chat accounts are not available until after the Business Chat service application has been approved by Apple.  

For more information on onboarding and maintaining the information on your business chat account, please refer to Apple’s [Onboarding Guide](https://register.apple.com/resources/business-chat/BC-OnboardingYourBCA.pdf).

## Design your Customer Experience  

In using business chat, Apple holds brands to high design standards as they aim to provide users with richness and delight across the iOS ecosystem. Once you have set up your business chat account, below are the steps we recommend for planning and designing your customer journey. 

**Define customer intents.** To provide a meaningful and enhanced customer experience, we encourage you to analyze the top reasons why customers contact your business today and consider how those issues are supported on your current channels today. Use these key intents in the routing list picker and build a workflow for resolution in Apple Business Chat. You will need to submit these use cases and the customer journey using this [use case template](https://static-assets.fs.liveperson.com/ABC/useCaseTemplate.xlsx).

**Plan entry points.** There are many ways for customers to get in touch with your brand via business chat, but it’s important to consider which one might be best for your business chat strategy as the effort to implement might vary.

**Consider Authentication.** Think about the use cases you would like to include for Apple Business Chat and assess if authentication will be required for any of them. If yes, what is the method for validating customers? You might want to consider business chat features such as OAuth 2.0, in-app authentication or LivePerson’s secure forms. 

**Consider Payment.** How might a customer make a payment and/ or make a purchase in business chat? Consider and plan for the end to end journey of transactional use cases, from payment collection to reporting. Existing brands leverage LivePerson’s secure forms for agent- driven transactions, as well as Maven Pay and  Apple Pay for the most seamless form of payment. 
 
## Brand Experience QA 

In order to launch with Business Chat, Apple must QA and approve your overall experience within the channel. Once your business chat configuration is complete and has gone through internal testing, you can go ahead and schedule the QA session with Apple. You will need to identify one or two agents for this session.
 
During the QA session, a representative from Apple will initiate a conversation with one of your agents and will simulate an actual customer query. They will evaluate the: 
* Conversation flow 
* Agent etiquette and 
* Usage of rich elements.

The brand normally handles QA with internal resources and provides results to LivePerson. Please review Apple's Conversational Design Guideline with your agents prior to the session.
