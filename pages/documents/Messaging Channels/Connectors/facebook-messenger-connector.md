With over a billion messages being sent between people and businesses per month on Facebook Messenger, it’s time that businesses had a tool to manage these messages at scale. LiveEngage is now seamlessly integrated into Facebook Messenger, offering your brand the opportunity to tap into these consumers on their preferred messaging channel. Set up is easy and allows your agents to create ongoing connections with valuable customers right away.

## Why use Facebook Messenger to connect with your consumers?

* **Meet consumers where they are** — Consumers can stay and use one popular app - Facebook Messenger - to connect to friends, families and now businesses.
* **Rich Messaging capabilities** — Rich Messaging capabilities like quick replies and consumer-to-agent audio messaging provide an enhanced messaging experience with more flexibility.
* **Enhanced indicators** — Read receipts and typing indication tell the consumer when agent is actively answering. The agent also benefits from knowing when the consumer receives the message.
* **Simple bot integrations** — Brands can plug their own bots into Facebook Messenger. Bots can then offer service and sales assistance to customers, with seamless transition to a human agent when required.
* **In-depth reporting** — Track and report on all Facebook Messenger interactions with detailed performance metrics within LivePerson’s platform.

### These can be found in your Facebook page settings, under messaging settings:

* **Greeting:** sends a response the first time a consumer opens a conversation with your brand on messenger.
* **Response assistant:** allows you to send custom instant replies to anyone who messages your page.
* **Response time:** displays SLAs you can customize yourself e.g. _Typically replies within an hour_.
* **Offline response:** lets customers know you are offline but will respond soon e.g. _Hi, we’re away right now but we’ll get back to you shortly_.

**Note:** The messages above will display in the agent workspace. Just like messages sent by agents, they have a character limit of 640.

## How conversations start

Brands and consumers can begin interacting over Facebook Messenger through multiple entry points, here are are some of the ways conversations can start:

* **Facebook Messenger app:** Consumers can begin conversations by searching for a brand directly within the Facebook Messenger app.
* **Facebook business page:** Brands can activate messaging capabilities on their Facebook business page, allowing consumers to click and start messaging.
* **Button on website:** Brands can embed a button on their website which invites consumers to message and launches Messenger.
* **Opting in:** Consumers can opt-in to receive purchase confirmation and updates via Messenger during the checkout process.
* **Offsite engagements:** Brands can embed a Message us button on ads, emails and other offsite locations.

## Adding an Agent Manager user to display third party messages

In order for messages sent directly from your Facebook Messenger inbox (via a Facebook page administrator or automated message) to appear in the agent workspace conversation thread, you will need to assign an Agent Manager user to whom the messages will be attributed.

On the Facebook connector page, under ‘Add a Facebook external user’, simply select the FB External User profile you have just created and click Done.
