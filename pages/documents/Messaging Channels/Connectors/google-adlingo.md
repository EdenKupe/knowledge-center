## How conversations start

A digital advertisement will be displayed to a consumer via the Google Display & Video 360 platform (part of the Google Marketing Platform). This ad will have a call to action within the creative to entice a consumer to click on it. When clicked, the consumer will be able to converse with the brand via LivePerson. The conversation will render within the ad itself for the consumer.
