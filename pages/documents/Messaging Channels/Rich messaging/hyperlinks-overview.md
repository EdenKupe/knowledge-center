## Introduction

Users using the enhanced agent workspace have the ability to share hyperlinks with consumers during a messaging conversation. In order to do so, a hyperlink button has been added above the agent input area, allowing agents to define the link text and URL:

After filling in the data and pressing OK, the agent will be able to share the hyperlink with the consumer, as part of the general message.

Within the agent input area, the hyperlink will appear in blue and underlined, to indicate that it is a hyperlink and the agent will be able to edit it as long as the message was not sent yet.
