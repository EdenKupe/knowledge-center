Conversational commerce lets people message anytime with businesses without having to call or search a website. Rich Messaging is the key to driving more actions directly within in your messaging conversation.

The LiveEngage messaging solution allows brands to send messages to customers in a variety of ways and formats making conversations more flexible - able to handle new and varying types of interactions. This enriches the consumer experience and gets your brand on board with conversational commerce.

**Rich messaging includes:**

* Structured content cards
* Structured content carousel
* Quick replies
* Photo sharing
* Audio messaging

**Structured content cards: build cards with buttons and images to turn a messaging experience in to a ‘_one stop shop’_ for customers.**

Structured content allows you to show simple cards which include text, images, catalogues, maps and buttons, to enhance the conversation with the consumer. When building your cards, you can have an ‘add to cart’ option, confirmation and deep linking buttons, turning a simple app interaction into conversational commerce. Structured content cards enables an improved and more efficient service opening up thousands of use cases- just what consumers expect from messaging.

Currently available for chat and messaging channels

**Structured content carousel: display product catalogues or service offerings directly within the conversation.**

The structured content carousel enables you to display several offerings on multiple cards directly within the conversation window. The carousel displays images along with direct action buttons which can help you drive sales without directing your consumers away from the messaging window.

Currently available for In-App messaging, Web-Messaging, and Facebook Connector.

**Quick replies: Create short pre-formatted instant replies to enable consumers to quickly and accurately state their intent for both bots and agents.**

Quick replies allows you to create short instant replies that consumers can select with a simple tap. As these answers are pre-formatted, not only is it quicker for the consumer and more intuitive for the agent, it even enables bots to seamlessly handle conversations.

Currently available for mobile app, web messaging, and Facebook Messenger.

For more information on quick replies including configuration and set up, please refer to our [quick replies user guide]()

**Photo sharing: Make messaging a more visual experience, increasing communication efficiency and reducing time to resolution.**

Please refer to Photo Sharing [photo sharing user guide]() for more information.

**Audio messaging**: **Consumers can communicate with brands easier and faster by sending voice recordings**

Audio messaging is ideal for consumers who want to send a long message and don’t want to type it on a small keypad and also mirrors the popular form of messaging amongst Generation Z. Consumers can tap, speak and send the audio message to an agent.

Currently, it’s only available on mobile App (v2.3) but will be added to additional channels in August.
