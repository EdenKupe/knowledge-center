With EmailConnect, brands can manage, analyze and respond to emails from the same command center that powers conversations on the world’s most popular messaging channels.

Brands can easily manage email conversations alongside conversations in messaging channels like Apple Business Chat, WhatsApp, SMS, Facebook Messenger, Web messaging and Google RBM, eliminating the need to switch between tools to respond to emails.

EmailConnect utilizes the powerful features available with other LiveEngage messaging channels, including support for bots powered by Maven, predefined content, reporting and smart capacity.

## Why brands should use EmailConnect

### Increase agent efficiency through a better email management tool

EmailConnect increases agent efficiency by unifying operations so that agents can manage all messaging conversations, including email conversations, within LiveEngage instead of using a separate platform for handling consumer emails.

### Single interface for all messaging

Agents handle emails in the same easy to use LiveEngage interface they use for all other messaging conversations, meaning the same set of agents can support email while they simultaneously support other messaging channels.

### Use bots and automations for emails

EmailConnect is fully compatible with LivePerson powered bots and AI, allowing brands to create email auto-responses or AI powered responses based on the content of emails.

### Simple email replies using predefined content

Email Connect has access to the same predefined content tools that are available across other messaging channels. Agents can drop in predefined email text to provide polish to every email response.

### Rich messaging capabilities

Send and receive email attachments using EmailConnect making emailing a more visual experience, increasing communication efficiency and reducing time to resolution. Attachments include images, pdfs and Microsoft Word and Excel documents. This may require feature enablement by LivePerson - see “EmailConnect Setup” below.

### Easy setup & onboarding

Brands can set-up EmailConnect in minutes by connecting to a company email address and uploading simple design elements, such as a header and footer (no tagging is required). Once the email address is set up, test the connection and then begin using Email Connect. Note that passwords are hidden and all your email credentials will be fully encrypted so that only you have access to them.

## Coming Soon

EmailConnect is quickly developing to expand our capability and increase the benefits to brands. Upcoming capabilities will include:

* **Custom templates for email replies —** Brands will be able to add custom html headers and footers to their outbound emails in the Email Connect Setup page.
* **File attachments settings —** Admins will be able to turn on or off the ability to support attachments from email setup.
* **Multiple email addresses —** Brands will be able to add an unlimited number of email addresses to LiveEngage and even route each email address to a different skill. For example, you can route info@, support@ and sales@ to different skills, allowing specialized bots and agents to handle your email interactions.
