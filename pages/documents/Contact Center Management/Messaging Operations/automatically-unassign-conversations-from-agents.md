## Introduction

The “automatic agent unassign” feature enables LivePerson to automatically unassign a conversation from an unresponsive agent after a consumer message (pending agent response), and send the conversation back to the queue. Through various use cases, the assigned agent could have been interrupted or simply went offline during a conversation with a consumer. The auto agent unassign feature can be configured to move this conversation to another available agent to ensure the highest level of conversational quality for our consumers.
     
This feature can be set up for agents in 3 different states: 
* Agent is Online, and unresponsive
* Agent has gone offline
* Agent is set to an Away state

## Why use agent unassign?

* Maintain better SLA’s for agent performance & consumer satisfaction
*  to save a customer from abandonment
* Protects any conversation that has gone unanswering at end of shift be moved to an agent who can then pick up the conversation

## Agent experience

1. Agent has an active conversation with the consumer. Consumer has sent the last message in the conversation when they asked what time the dealership opened on Saturday.

{:start="2"}
2. The assigned agent at this point has stepped away from their desk to be defined as an unresponsive agent. 60 seconds has now passed since the consumer message, and the platform auto unassigned the agent from the conversation and returned it to the queue.

The consumer has a seamless experience when one agent is unassigned from the conversation and a new agent takes over.
