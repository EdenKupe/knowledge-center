For web messaging and live chat engagements, the engagement window hosts the conversation. In the engagement window studio, brands can fully customize and tailor the window, with control over every aspect, from fonts and button style to icon colors and positioning.

## The Engagement window studio

To provide a consistent experience across devices, you can design identical engagement windows for both desktop and mobile versions of the platform. Using the **Engagement window studio**, you can design a chat window once and use it across any number of engagements.

### To access the Engagement window studio:

1. Open the **Engagement window library**

![](/img/engagement window 1.png)

1. Hover over an existing window design and click **Edit** or click **Add new** to design a new window. Once you have designed the window it will be added to your Engagement window library for future use.
2. After clicking **Add new__, the Engagement window studio opens__.**

**Note**: In the Engagement window library, you can delete window designs that are not in use by clicking the **Action** menu and selecting **Delete**. In addition, you can set a default window design by clicking the **Action** menu and selecting **Set as default**. To see which campaigns are using each window design, hover over the link icon.

The **Engagement window studio** allows you to customize the look and feel of both desktop and mobile windows**.** Any change you perform to the design of the desktop window takes effect in the mobile window as well.

**Please note**: If your header or image is not the full body width of the window, the background color will be displayed on the sides. If you upload images with a height of more than 32 pixels, the system will resize the image to fit the available height (32 pixels), while maintaining the ratio of the image. If the width of the image is greater than the widget of the window, it will align to the right. The recommended width (140 pixels) is mostly for logos.

### To add additional functionality to your window:

1\. Click the **Action menu** button or click the **+** button in the desktop preview.

### Agent picture configuration

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oH7KS6n1Ty0oKfpxXfWee23MEEmfVHA6Fwzte6_7gUHS2AO6EYN3nxR35aZeoHb_MnbZIZhEWQdO5w48qVCInleTnq_SBXTWrcqJLzm1QMKFyss99xmSWFxHIjyFNjtynKJ0LkMN =302x339)

**Note:** URL must be in “https” format, with recommended size of 200x200 pixels (up to 0.5MB), supported formats are PNG, JPG, and GIF

1. Click **Save**

### Defining agent picture appearance in the engagement window

Agent picture is defined individually per window. If you are using the same window in different engagements/campaigns, visitors will see the agent’s picture in both of them.

**In order to define the agent’s picture in the selected engagement window, follow these steps:**

1. Select the desired window from the Engagement window library
2. In the Engagement window studio select **Open additional window settings**

**![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Iz3B1dm7hpbpSYGz7aBnxh30kEsLO4WFYtsNlxxSRr8wFFL4XoYP0ozUZ2JTTcfgtmrdqNL_qT1LI-vwL-xGr_fMYirReYVtVuj79UkuqwMGcYzWCamT_gIWi2ZG9lMadk2cNF15 =624x255)**

1. In the engagement window category, find the Agent picture row
2. In the value column, select **Yes** from the dropdown menu in order to enable agent picture for the selected engagement window

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aeoxGidgSTED3i-zkIs8r7CBcP-DujHLrEfx-Z_-eYsRIZeplsM9Xi_PHrNpSKvZF9CaExyy-0t13ZV-9nsQaKOOf-86yzpeNlyyPlvb8KxHErSbPwYi7KiTi8mn_YbvddbRbDbP =624x252)

1. Click **Save**

Now the visitor will see their agent’s picture next to each line sent by the agent in the chat engagement window:

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zlSwZdo6prTfC2q7vigBKWvzpPdCj3woWMPVkVgDXa2WvaJlEBQe99kjM_UIQjLRr9A0P_Igdl4RH_dfiQf33ZWo2EWgqrVEcdcddI1ikcW_zG0TDJ3rMg2zafmahv6MxQOlxXya =241x348)

**Note:** In the case that the agent picture is enabled for a window but the agent did not configure their picture yet, the visitor will not see any picture while chatting with this specific agent.

### Configuring a default picture

**In order to define a default picture to be displayed when no agent picture is defined, follow these steps:**

1. Select the desired window from the Engagement window library
2. In the Engagement window studio select **Open additional window settings**
3. In the Engagement window category, locate the Agent picture default URL row
4. In the Value column, add the URL of the default picture to be displayed for agents who did not configure their picture

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5BXNH2qN4dZmWlZjY0DfD7xhB_-ftqQoY1OXoM28vAF4HHT7TKKB2egoEm9XnHzVecS15D4EECBtsxcTaqU367NUPZRY-eSVJDzjTWPWs-eKPZ3wzuLFrXNbrqxDppsv88INEh2j =624x240)

1. Click “Save”

Visitors will now see the configured default picture beside each line sent by the agent with no configured personal picture.

### Limitations

* **Join conversation:** If a second agent joins the conversation for whom a default picture URL is defined, the visitor sees the default picture next to second agent’s lines.
* **Because each window is configured separately, take into account the following:**

In the case that different default pictures are defined in different engagement windows, when an agent transfers the conversation to an agent that has no assigned picture, the default picture displayed is the default picture defined for the conversation’s original engagement window. This is relevant to accounts using separate engagement windows for different departments.
