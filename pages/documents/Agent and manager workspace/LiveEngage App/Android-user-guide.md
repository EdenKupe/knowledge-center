The LivePerson Agent app is an Android application that allows agents and agent managers to message with consumers on-the-go. The current app offers simple messaging capabilities and can help agents that are working from home to continue to provide services to their consumers. 

In addition to allowing reps to work remotely, the app also expands opportunities for messaging scenarios. For example, in stores, retail reps can leverage their down time by messaging with customers not in store, utilizing retail reps as agents and giving them the power to increase sales.
