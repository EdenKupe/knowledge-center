Hot keys help agents manage multiple, simultaneous tasks, by providing shortcuts to easily move between tasks, such as opening the Visitor List, toggling your status, and transferring chats to other agents.

There are seven hot keys available in the Agent Workspace. Open the hot keys menu by holding down the control and tilde keys (CTRL + \~).

Select an action by pressing the applicable letter:

* LOGOUT (L): to logout of the Agent Workspace
* ACCEPT ENGAGEMENT (A): to accept a new incoming chat. Only available when an engagement is ringing.
* VISITOR LIST (V): to access the list of your current visitors
* STATUS (S): to toggle your status between Online, Back Soon and Away
* END ENGAGEMENT (X): to end the current chat. Only available when you have an open conversation.
* TRANSFER ENGAGEMENT (T): to transfer the chat to another agent. Only available when you have an open conversation.
* RESPOND TO NEXT (M): navigate to the visitor who has been waiting the longest for a response from the agent. Only available when you have multiple open conversations.
* RETURN CONVERSATION TO QUEUE (Q): returns the currently focused conversation to the queue. Only available when you have a conversation that can be transfered back to the queue.
