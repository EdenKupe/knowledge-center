## Migrating plan
In 2019, LivePerson launched the enhanced agent workspace for messaging. On September 14th 2020, we will be retiring the old workspace. After that date, the link to revert back to the old workspace will no longer be available.   

Many customers have already moved to the new workspace and are benefiting from its enhancements and new functionalities. We’ve updated the new workspace to the WCAG accessibility standards and this workspace simplifies agent operations and dramatically increases efficiency.

It’s designed to handle multiple channels of conversation at scale asynchronously, taking into account all of the features that were developed especially for messaging. Specifically, the workspace has a new look and feel, a dynamic conversation list with built-in automation sorts conversations by the response time. It shows a full history of the conversation within the same window, enhanced customization of options and more. Click here for more details.

You will easily be able to navigate between the two workspaces and the icons on the side bar will display notifications for incoming messages per workspace. Check out the new experience.

Upon login, all your users will automatically see the enhanced agent workspace for messaging and will be able to use all its tools and functionalities.
