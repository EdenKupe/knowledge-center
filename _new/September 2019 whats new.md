**Live chat users** received a new navigation bar with updated icons. The agent status menu can be found on the bottom left of the sidebar.

There is also new UI for the Conversation Builder and & Conversational AI tab

## Agent survey 

Agent surveys prompt agents to record information about the conversation topic (e.g. sale/support/billing), update the sales lead status, and more.

The information can be used to optimize brand operations, improve campaigns, train agents, get additional information about conversions, reduce the need to transfer, and more.  

Currently, brands use the agent survey in chat to categorize, qualify and collect more info about the conversation. The agent survey feature will be added to messaging conversations to provide similar benefits.

Admins will be able to configure the survey questions, timeout and skill. The survey will appear as a new widget in the agent workspace and each conversation can have multiple surveys submitted.

## Static load balancing per skill

Static load balancing per skill is a messaging vendor management tool. It supports brands when messaging support and sales centers operations are handled by multiple care center vendors and enabled brands to distribute their messaging operations. 

For example, sales vs support can be divided by contact center. - i.e, 30% of the traffic of messaging will be handled by vendor A, 20% by vendor B, and 20% be handled by vendor C. 

## Queue priority by authenticated consumer attributes

This feature enables brands to assign predefined velocity in queue to conversations based on their consumer engagement attributes. This way, brands can define that conversations with high-profile customers receive a velocity factor that helps them advance faster in the queue - reducing the response time for these consumers. 

For example, consumers marked as Gold members, their conversations can be set to advance to the front of the queue faster.
