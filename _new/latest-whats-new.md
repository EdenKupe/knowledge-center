Here are the latest features, enhancements and enablements that are coming in the following weeks.

## Performance Optimizer
At the core of the Performance Optimizer is a dashboard and enablement framework that clearly articulates how primary and secondary KPIs influence success and align to the LivePerson 4E Framework (TM) pillars of Efficiency, Effectiveness, Effort, and Emotion.
The Performance Optimizer has anonymized brand comparisons, industry benchmarks, segmentations, and KPI targets.  
A Configuration Engine within the Performance Portal allows brands to define reporting units and save data in relevant segmentations. 
Narrative-driven dashboards and data contextualization allow people to diagnose issues in a faster, more intelligent way.

## Intent Manager 
In the coming weeks, we have many exciting updates to the Intent Manager.

![](img/Intentmanager-whats-new.gif)

New features will be added to Intent Discovery & Optimization to help brands discover new topics and quickly find diverse training phrases for building new intents. Brands will have the ability to create, save, and manage advanced filters, as well as customize and configure metric widgets to better suit different personas and use cases. 

Expanded starter packs will be introduced for intents including initial tests for FinServ + Cross Vertical Intents followed by adding Cross Vertical intents to Telco, Airlines and Insurance SPs.

New configurable metrics are now available in LivePerson’s Intent Analyzer to better evaluate conversations by intent.
New metrics which have been added are as follows:
- Net Promoter score 
- % fully automated conversations
- % partially automated conversations
- % agent only conversations
- Average number of transfers
- Average number of agent/bot responses
- Average number of consumer messages

## Intent-Powered Queue prioritization
Brands can configure their customer queuing logic to prioritize specified high-value intents. For more information on Queue Prioritization, click here.

## Voice and Video calling 
The consumer's engagement window is expanded to show the video/call invitation and once accepted the call takes place via the extended engagement window. The agent sees the consumer via a dedicated voice and video agent window. Both agent and consumer use their device’s audio and video capabilities like with Zoom or Google Hangouts. 

The feature will be set to ON by default for all users on all accounts, it can be disabled by contacting your LivePerson representative. You can also control access to the feature fwdeedrom the profile permissions.

## Agent App updates
## Pagination (Android Version)
In the initial version of the app only the first 50 historic conversations were shown. In the new version when you scroll down it loads more conversations after you reach 50.

## Mobile SDK updates
There are a number of Mobile SDK updates in the coming release:

## Auto Logout - Improve logout options 
An SDK enhancement has been added that will prevent a second customer from viewing the chat history of the customer who chatted before them, while optimizing the flow in a way that clears just the necessary set of user information in a quick manner. This new feature adds an additional layer of security to our brands, by verifying that conversation history and information will be available only to the consumer who was logged in to the app at the time of the conversation. This feature is enabled out of the box.

## iOS Mobile SDK 6.0: Support for XCFramework
The new mobile SDK version launched with XCFramework support. This new framework provides the following advantages:
1. XCFramework uses Swift Module Interface which lists out all the public APIs of the module in a textual format that behaves like source code. Since they behave like source code, future versions of the Swift Compiler will be able to import the module interfaces created with older versions. This removes the version-lock currently in Swift.
2. Today, our SDK builds the universal framework for the clients that supports both devices and simulators. Before submitting the app, the clients need to remove x86_64 which is the simulator architecture. The new XCFramework simplifies all this by eliminating the need for building a universal framework. In the process of producing the XCFramework, all the supported architectures caIIn the initial version of the app only the first 50 historic conversations were shown. In the new version when you scroll down it loads more conversations after you reach 50.n the initial version of the app only the first 50 historic conversations were shown. In the new version when you scroll down it loads more conversations after you reach 50.n be combined within one XCFramework.
3. XCFramework packages all dependencies under all target platforms and architectures into one single bundle. More information about XCFramework can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/416/), and the Xcode help article can be found [here.](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/11.4/#/dev51a648b07) 

## iOS Mobile SDK: Xcode 12 beta support - Limited release of SDK 6.0.1 and 5.2.1
In order to allow our brands and their developers to prepare for iOS14 while building and getting ready with their apps for the next iOS Launch, we released two limited SDK versions that will support compiling the app with Xcode 12 beta version and Swift 5.3.

## Facebook Referral parameter
The Messenger platform supports the passing of an arbitrary parameter via these m.me links. This can be used for many purposes, such as tracking different links placed in different channels, or tying a Messenger user to a session or account in an external app. You can even use it to direct the user to specific content or features available within your Messenger experience. An m.me link with an added parameter looks like this:
http://m.me/<PAGE_NAME>?ref=<REF_PARAM>

Based on the consumer intent, it will enable brands to pass the "ref" parameter into the conversation.This can then be used for routing or shown to an agent as ‘status’ SDE in the consumer info for reference.
Please note that The brand must resubscribe to the Facebook page again in order to use this feature.
Limitations
The referral parameter must be a string that may be up to 2,083 characters in length.
The page to which the app is connected must be published to receive the referral parameter for all users, except users who have the developer, tester, or admin role for your bot.
The referral parameter is supported in the Messenger web client, as well as the Messenger app for iOS and Android version 92.0 and above.

## Proactive Messaging (Early Access)
Low-to-no-code solution that lets brands build the business logic to automatically send out outbound messages using the Proactive API when an event is triggered in their CRM system, expediting brands' production launch in response to COVID-19. 

Brands can set up a quick integration with common out-of-the-box CRM systems, such as Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics. Using a third-party platform, brands connect to their CRM system and design the event trigger business logic workflow. Brands can extract the data from their internal system to personalize the outbound message in Proactive. Brands have full control of the business logic workflow design. When the event is triggered, Proactive sends the outbound message to the recipients on the specified channel, and later routes the responses to the bots or agents with the specified skill in the workflow.

For more information on Proactive Messaging, click [here.](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/messaging-channels-proactive-messaging-proactive-messaging-overview.html)

## Canceling a Proactive outbound campaign
When a Proactive outbound campaign is created today, there isn’t a way to cancel it. With this release, brands will be able to cancel the campaign by themselves from the UI. 
When a campaign containing multiple recipients is canceled, Proactive will stop sending the outbound messages only to the set of recipients who have not yet been sent the message at that time. This means, if a Proactive campaign is scheduled for 09:10:01, and it’s canceled at 09:10:31, any messages that are already sent during that time will NOT be canceled. Any messages that have not been sent during that time will be canceled. 

## Customized text for prioritized channel in Proactive Messaging
When sending outbound messages on Proactive Messaging, brands can select ‘Prioritized’ channel. This means that the outbound message will first be sent on WhatsApp, and if the consumer phone number is not eligible on WhatsApp, the message will be sent via SMS. When ‘Prioritized’ channel is selected today, the WhatsApp message template content is copied to the SMS section without an option to edit. With this release, brands will be able to edit the SMS fallback message if they choose to. 

## WhatsApp template in Proactive Messaging
When a WhatsApp message template is submitted to WhatsApp for approval, it can be rejected. With this release, we add a column to show the reason for the rejection as provided by WhatsApp. This will give brands insight and enable them to resubmit the template accordingly. 
In addition, , there can be multiple phone numbers associated with a single WhatsApp Account ID. When a brand creates a WhatsApp message template, it is useful to see what phone numbers are associated with the WhatsApp Account ID they are creating the template with. This enables brands to know if the message template can be used when sending outbound messages.

WhatsApp Media and Interactive templates for Proactive messaging
LivePerson is enhancing the Proactive Messaging template by adding structure and flexibility. Additional content has been added so you can send recipients enriched media, including headers and footers, documents, images, videos etc. 

## Conversation Manager updates

## Skills-level view
Today, when tracking the performance of multiple skills, managers are required to manually filter the workspace skill by skill, in order to view the data they need. A new skill-level table will be added to the workspace, allowing managers to do this more easily. In addition, the new view will allow users to track additional new metrics as "Actionable" and "Wait time for assignment (50%)".

## Reporting updates

## Secure Forms ( PCI) for messaging reporting
Brands using Secure Forms in messaging have greater visibility/transparency in payments and are able to measure the ROI. This feature allows users to cross examine with other metrics such as CSAT and conversions to see how the feature is performing and impacting customer satisfaction and revenue generation.

## Post Conversion Survey reporting improvements
The survey messaging dashboard will be enhanced to include attribution of messaging survey results to include bots.

## Collaboration channels for messaging reporting
Brands using the collaboration channels (CoBrowse, Video, Voice) in messaging will have metrics on how many times CoBrowse /Voice and Video was used by agents. This allows customers to cross examine with other metrics such as CSAT and conversions to measure the feature’s ROI.

## Outbound Messaging for Apple Business Chat (ABC)
Outbound Messaging for Apple Business Chat (ABC) enables brands to message their customers and initiate an outbound message to notify their customers of something (e.g. for a bill reminder). Customers can then leverage the messaging platform to pay their bills in just a few clicks and receive a notification when payment is complete. 

## Multi-Channel Engagements (Web + SMS)
Multi-Channel Engagements enable brands to allow users to start a Web Messaging or SMS conversation from a desktop or mobile engagement. This includes the ability to create an SMS-only engagement that works on desktop by prompting a user to enter their phone number, and engagements with a textbox that consumers can type directly into.

![](img/whats-new-sept4.gif)

## Window title bar - Allow customizations and WCAG support
Brands will be able to customize the text in the conversation window title bar. This is a feature enhancement sub-item of WCAG 2.1 Certification efforts.

## SMS self-service - Support all brand-owned numbers
This feature allows brands to configure their Twilio phone numbers for all countries. Currently this is limited to +1 international code from within the Conversational Cloud platform.

## Third-Party bots - Conversation Tester
Brands will now be able to have mock conversations with their onboarded bot directly from the 3rd-party bot interface. They will be able to test out the responses of the bot and troubleshoot issues. The tester will create a conversation with the bot and will present feedback and error messages to the tester, allowing brands to validate their bot's flows and correct issues. The tester will help establish if intents are missed, or if structured content is wrongly set up, empowering the brand to make corrections before letting the bot communicate with their consumers.

## Functions Key/Value Store
This enhancement provides a simple integrated storage that lambdas can use to save customer data.

## Third-party bots - Conversation error logs
A new tab is being introduced n the Bot UI, making it very easy for a brand or bot tuner to discover, debug and resolve errors in bot configuration. This will eliminate unnecessary escalations from the bot to a human agent. 

## Third-party bots - Trigger Function on demand
Bots will be able to send the Third-party bot platform a command to trigger a FaaS function on demand. This will allow bot designers to create custom flows that will leverage the Functions capability as part of the conversational design.

## Conversation Orchestrator
Context Intelligence - SDEs available in Context Warehouse and Routing policies
Brands can use SDEs (Structured Data Entities) to send custom attributes when initiating a conversation from both unauthenticated and authenticated flows. UI tools are provided in the workspace that allow brands to use SDEs to build complex routing policies without the need to understand coding.

## Dynamic Routing Workspace
Improve UX for large number of attributes and policies.

## Announcements
## Migration to the enhanced Agent Workspace took place on September 14th

On September 14th 2020, LivePerson successfully migrated our messaging customers to the enhanced Agent Workspace. The option to revert back to the old workspace will no longer be available. The new workspace simplifies agent operations and dramatically increases efficiency, and it has been updated to meet the WCAG accessibility standards.

## Realtime Dashboard for Messaging - End of life 
On December 31st 2020, the Realtime Dashboard for Messaging will be deprecated.
The Realtime Dashboard was developed before the new Manager Workspace was introduced. The new Manager Workspace is embedded into the core platform, allowing users to manage their operation seamlessly and in real time, eliminating the need to support the Realtime Dashboard. 

Note: Chat users will not be affected by this at this time. For more information on the new Manager Workspace, click [here.](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/agent-manager-workspace-manager-tools-for-messaging-new-manager-workspace-for-messaging-introducing-the-new-manager-tools.html)

## Internet Explorer 11 -  End of Life
Microsoft 365 apps and services will no longer support Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) and will move to support the new Microsoft Edge. By November 30th, 2020, the Microsoft team’s web app will no longer support IE 11. By August 17th, 2021, the remaining Microsoft 365 apps and services will no longer support IE 11. This means customers still using IE11 will have a degraded experience or will be unable to connect to Microsoft 365 apps and services. As such, LivePerson is discontinuing support of IE11 in line with the above dates, as we don’t want our customers to be negatively impacted by this change. Though LivePerson supports Microsoft Edge and FireFox, the recommended browser for messaging workspace is Chrome.

For more information, please see the Microsoft announcement [here.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666)
