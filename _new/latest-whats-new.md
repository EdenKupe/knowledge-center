LivePerson has additional improvements coming soon including Message history improvements. A consumer's messaging history can be very long and from a long time period, up to 13 months. While we want this history to be available, long histories create problems for screen readers (WCAG) and performance of a new conversation. As such, users will soon be able to collapse the messaging history and allow the consumer to decide if they want to see past interactions. 
This is a feature enhancement sub-item of WCAG 2.1 Certification efforts.
