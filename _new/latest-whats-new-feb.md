## The new LivePerson AI Annotator!

Automate even more conversations by empowering agents to flag bot issues and suggest a solution within seconds, while going about their day to day tasks. AI Annotator provides agents and QA teams who view conversations with the ability to suggest correct intents to messages that the bot did not understand. Once the suggestion is approved by a manager, similar messages will be correctly identified by the bot. This process of labeling data which is later used to improve an AI model, is called AI Annotation.

## Social Messaging 2.0
Social Messaging extends LivePerson’s industry-leading conversational commerce platform, AI and automation capabilities, and multi-decade expertise in connecting brands with customers, into the world of social media.

Social Messaging enables brands to interact with consumers over Twitter and Facebook through the Conversational Cloud. For each new channel, conversations can take place both in public (on Twitter Tweets that mention the brand, and Facebook Page posts and comments), in private (Twitter direct messages and Facebook Messenger), or a mix of public and private messaging in the same conversation.  

Social Messaging 2.0 includes the following features:
* Channel indication: The My Conversations list has been enhanced with a new icon showing the conversation source, so that the agent will be able to identify the channel that the consumer is originating from.
* New Social Messaging widget: A new core widget is now available for all Social Messaging conversations. 
The widget’s main benefits:
View Consumer Profile - View the publicly available social media profile of the consumer you’re interacting with from within Conversational Cloud
Clear context for the conversation - View the consumer post from within the Conversational Cloud, nested under its parent post, to have clear context of the conversation topic


Reply to specific consumer messages: Agents have the ability to reply to a specific consumer message, to ensure that consumers are getting relevant replies to each of their posts.


Public to Private: Quickly transition conversations from public social media to private by simply clicking the “Public to Private” button, which sends a large call to action button for the consumer to select. 


Mention consumer in reply: Agents will be able to mention consumers with their Facebook username in their replies, so that consumers will get a notification that they have been mentioned by the brand in the native platform.
