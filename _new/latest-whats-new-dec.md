### This year we launched…

## The Conversational Cloud

The Conversational Cloud was officially launched and LivePerson renamed many of its products to better reflect their capabilities. For more information on LivePerson’s product architecture, click [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/admin-settings-product-renaming-overview.html)

## Performance Optimizer
LivePerson launched the Performance Optimizer, which is a product within the Conversational Cloud that converges numerous strategic metrics for different Lines of Business into the LivePerson 4E Framework™, driving probability and business growth.
The Performance Optimizer is LivePerson’s first analytical product geared towards C-suite executives, Lines of Business, and organizational decision makers. The Performance Optimizer contextualizes data through anonymized brand comparisons, anonymized industry benchmarks, segmentations, and KPI targets. Narrative-driven dashboards and data contextualization allow managers to diagnose performance opportunities in a faster, more intelligent way.
The Performance Optimizer has a simple graphic interface, requiring no advanced cognitive skills such as complex information processing, data analysis or mathematical skills. This provides users with accurate results, actionable information, and recipes for success.
