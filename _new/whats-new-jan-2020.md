Recently, LivePerson launched the New Manager workspace and the Enhanced Agent Workspace for messaging. We’ve made some important updates to these workspaces based on great feedback from our users.

### New Manager Workspace 

## Global Skill Filter
We’re making it easier for managers to make data driven decisions by allowing them to easily filter the entire workspace by specific skills. Until now, the skill filter was available per widget (ie., queue summary, agents and conversation widget). 
When filtering by skill, the agent’s widget will retrieve the list of agents which are assigned to the selected skills.  The metrics associated will not be filtered according to the skill, but for all of the agent’s activity. For example, if an agent is assigned multiple skills, the metrics will reflect all of their conversations and not just the filtered skill.
- The filter is available on the top right corner of the page.
- The new filter impacts all widgets and metrics available.
- Anyone who accesses the manager workspace will be able to view.

{: .notice}
This filter will be automatically enabled for any user that is using the new manager workspace.

## Global filter setting at logout retained upon login [New Manager workspace]
In order to spare managers from resetting their workspace filter preferences each time they log in, the global filter settings will be saved automatically. The filters that are retained are only the global filters (available at the top right corner of the workspace) including: timeframe, group and skill filters. 
{: .notice}
The filter settings are kept on the local storage of the specific computer and browser per user.

## Active metric added to agent card view [New Manager workspace] 
The “active” metric which was available until today only on the list view of the agents widget has been added to the card view as well. The metric displays the number of conversations at full intensity. 
{: .notice}
This will automatically be enabled for any user that enabled the new manager workspace.

## Wait time metric [New Manager workspace]
A new metric, “Wait time” has been added to the “Queue summary” widget. The metric is shown by skill breakdown. 

The metric displays the 90th percentile of the consumers wait time for an agent assignment. This means that 90% of consumers are currently waiting for an agent assignment X amount of time or less. 

{: .note}
Automatically enabled for any user that enabled the new manager workspace.

## Overdue metrics [New Manager workspace]
The overdue metrics have been added in two locations:
**Activity summary** - This metric displays the number of conversations assigned to agents that exceeded the target response time. The metric will include only the conversations of agents under the groups the manager is managing.
**Queue summary** - This metric displays the number of conversations waiting in queue that exceeded the target response time. The metric will include only the conversations assigned to skills the manager is managing.

{: .notice}
Automatically enabled for any user that enabled the new manager workspace.

## Filter by specific hour [New Manager workspace]

Ability to set and monitor operations performance from specific hours, such as the beginning of a shift or the beginning of a business day.
Until now, users have only been able to change the time range of the manager workspace to view data from the past X hours (maximum supported time range being 24 hours).

With new ‘filter by specific hour’, users can filter the workspace from a specific hour in time, in a range between midnight and the current time. 

## Seamless Navigation from agent to manager workspace 

We're making it easier to navigate between the enhanced agent workspace for messaging and manager workspace for a better user experience. When a user drills down to read a transcript of a specific conversation from the “Conversations widget” in the manager workspace, the user is navigated to the enhanced agent workspace. In order to navigate back to the conversation list, users can click the new “Back to Manager workspace” button in one simple click.

{: .notice}
Applies only to messaging agent managers who are using both the new manager workspace and the enhanced agent workspace

### Enhanced Agent Workspace for Messaging
## Personalize the predefined content widget display [enhanced agent workspace for messgaing]
In the enhanced workspace for messaging - each agent will be able to personalize how they'd like to view their predefined content widget and in how much detail. The predefined content widget enables each user to decide whether to display each content as titles &  text, or to hide the content text and display the titles only. If the user chooses the “Titles only” display, hovering each item will display it’s content on a tooltip for assistance. 

{: . notice}
The configuration is enabled per agent only and does not affect the entire account.

## Deselect conversation [enhanced agent workspace for messgaing]
Increase efficiency and user experience in the enhanced agent workspace for messaging by enabling agents to work in a mode where they are not focused on a particular conversation.  This work mode enables a clear the workspace, or focus on other tasks. Just click on the  action menu and choose “Unselect conversation”.
When choosing this option, the conversation will disappear from the user’s screen and will only be visible from the “My connections” list). 

## Display summary notes to previous conversations [enhanced agent workspace for messgaing]
Agents will receive a more holistic picture of previous conversations with a consumer through the addition of summary notes to the conversation history and notes. 
In the new workspace, previous conversations are displayed above the current conversation.
We now are added the ability to see previous conversations summary as written by previous agents who participated in the conversation (one or more). 

## New applications dashboard
The new Applications dashboard gives brands and partners the ability to manage all LivePerson applications on a self-serve basis. It also exposes them to applications that developers have created by presenting them with information about the application, such as an overview of the app and screenshots from the app. By using the dashboard, an admin can enable or disable the app, decide which user profiles can use this app, change its name and icon, and decide if the app should be launched from the Quick launch menu. Read the internal release notes for
more info.

## New structured content template “Multiple select checkbox”
The Multiple select checkbox template enables humans or automated agents (bots) to share a list of items, while allowing the consumer to select multiple items and reply back with their selection. 
The template increases use cases brands can serve on messaging and allows brands to more efficiently receive input from customers for complex questions. 
For consumer; they will be able to select their choices and click on the action button to submit. Once submitted, the consumer's selections will be sent as a message on behalf of the consumer, appearing in the conversation transcript.

{: . notice}
The consumer selections will be displayed as plain text, with a comma separator between each selection.

If you are using a bot to send the structured content template, the consumer selection will be published as part of the conversation metadata. Using Messaging Agent SDK, bots can access conversation metadata and analyze the consumer selections.

For agents, the consumer selections will be displayed as a consumer message in the agent workspace as part of the conversation transcript.

## Hyperlinks for Messaging
When messaging, users will be able to share hyperlinks with consumers as part of the general message. Within the agent input area, a new button will appear that enables agents to add the URL link and title to be displayed while sending to the consumer. 

## Post conversation survey in the Conversation Builder
Customers can use Conversation Builder for all their bot needs, including surveys as the Post Conversation Survey is now in the Conversation Builder platform.
Brands can now ask their customers to fill a brief survey at the end of a conversation and collect feedback in a single flow. The collected data provides valuable insights about the customer experience. For more information on the Conversation Builder, click here.
