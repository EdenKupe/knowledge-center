Recently, LivePerson launched the New Manager workspace and the Enhanced Agent Workspace for messaging. We’ve made some important updates to these workspaces based on great feedback from our users.

### New Manager Workspace 

## Global Skill Filter
We’re making it easier for managers to make data driven decisions by allowing them to easily filter the entire workspace by specific skills. Until now, the skill filter was available per widget (ie., queue summary, agents and conversation widget). 
When filtering by skill, the agent’s widget will retrieve the list of agents which are assigned to the selected skills.  The metrics associated will not be filtered according to the skill, but for all of the agent’s activity. For example, if an agent is assigned multiple skills, the metrics will reflect all of their conversations and not just the filtered skill.
- The filter is available on the top right corner of the page.
- The new filter impacts all widgets and metrics available.
- Anyone who accesses the manager workspace will be able to view.

{: .notice}
This filter will be automatically enabled for any user that is using the new manager workspace.

## Global filter setting at logout retained upon login [New Manager workspace]
In order to spare managers from resetting their workspace filter preferences each time they log in, the global filter settings will be saved automatically. The filters that are retained are only the global filters (available at the top right corner of the workspace) including: timeframe, group and skill filters. 
{: .notice}
The filter settings are kept on the local storage of the specific computer and browser per user.

## Active metric added to agent card view [New Manager workspace] 
The “active” metric which was available until today only on the list view of the agents widget has been added to the card view as well. The metric displays the number of conversations at full intensity. 
{: .notice}
This will automatically be enabled for any user that enabled the new manager workspace.

## Wait time metric [New Manager workspace]
A new metric, “Wait time” has been added to the “Queue summary” widget. The metric is shown by skill breakdown. 

The metric displays the 90th percentile of the consumers wait time for an agent assignment. This means that 90% of consumers are currently waiting for an agent assignment X amount of time or less. 

{: .note}
Automatically enabled for any user that enabled the new manager workspace.

## Overdue metrics [New Manager workspace]
The overdue metrics have been added in two locations:
**Activity summary** - This metric displays the number of conversations assigned to agents that exceeded the target response time. The metric will include only the conversations of agents under the groups the manager is managing.
**Queue summary** - This metric displays the number of conversations waiting in queue that exceeded the target response time. The metric will include only the conversations assigned to skills the manager is managing.

{: .notice}
Automatically enabled for any user that enabled the new manager workspace.

## Filter by specific hour [New Manager workspace]

Ability to set and monitor operations performance from specific hours, such as the beginning of a shift or the beginning of a business day.
Until now, users have only been able to change the time range of the manager workspace to view data from the past X hours (maximum supported time range being 24 hours).

With new ‘filter by specific hour’, users can filter the workspace from a specific hour in time, in a range between midnight and the current time. 

## Seamless Navigation from agent to manager workspace 

We're making it easier to navigate between the enhanced agent workspace for messaging and manager workspace for a better user experience. When a user drills down to read a transcript of a specific conversation from the “Conversations widget” in the manager workspace, the user is navigated to the enhanced agent workspace. In order to navigate back to the conversation list, users can click the new “Back to Manager workspace” button in one simple click.

{: .notice}
Applies only to messaging agent managers who are using both the new manager workspace and the enhanced agent workspace
