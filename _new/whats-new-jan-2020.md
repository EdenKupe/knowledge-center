Recently, LivePerson launched the New Manager workspace and the Enhanced Agent Workspace for messaging. We’ve made some important updates to these workspaces based on great feedback from our users.

### New Manager Workspace 

## Global Skill Filter
We’re making it easier for managers to make data driven decisions by allowing them to easily filter the entire workspace by specific skills. Until now, the skill filter was available per widget (ie., queue summary, agents and conversation widget). 
When filtering by skill, the agent’s widget will retrieve the list of agents which are assigned to the selected skills.  The metrics associated will not be filtered according to the skill, but for all of the agent’s activity. For example, if an agent is assigned multiple skills, the metrics will reflect all of their conversations and not just the filtered skill.
- The filter is available on the top right corner of the page.
- The new filter impacts all widgets and metrics available.
- Anyone who accesses the manager workspace will be able to view.

{: .notice}
This filter will be automatically enabled for any user that is using the new manager workspace.

## Global filter setting at logout retained upon login 
In order to spare managers from resetting their workspace filter preferences each time they log in, the global filter settings will be saved automatically. The filters that are retained are only the global filters (available at the top right corner of the workspace) including: timeframe, group and skill filters. 

{: .notice}
The filter settings are kept on the local storage of the specific computer and browser per user.

## Active metric added to agent card view  
The “active” metric which was available until today only on the list view of the agents widget has been added to the card view as well. The metric displays the number of conversations at full intensity.
