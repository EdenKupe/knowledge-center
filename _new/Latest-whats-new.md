Intent Manager
Intent Discovery and Optimization
The Intent Discovery and Optimization feature will enable brands to quickly uncover patterns in their existing data, better discover high impact intents, and automatically develop training phrases to train their machine learning models. It creates a tight integration between Intent Analyzer and Intent Builder making it easy for users to annotate incorrectly classified messages so that models can be improved and new intent classes can be created.
