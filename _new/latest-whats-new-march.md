## The new LivePerson AI Annotator!
Automate even more conversations by empowering agents to flag bot issues and suggest a solution within seconds, while going about their day to day tasks. AI Annotator provides agents and QA teams who view conversations with the ability to suggest correct intents to messages that the bot did not understand. Once the suggestion is approved by a manager, similar messages will be correctly identified by the bot. This process of labeling data which is later used to improve an AI model, is called AI Annotation.
