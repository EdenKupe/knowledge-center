## Light mode

A few months ago, LivePersonâ€™s agent and manager workspaces received a major facelift with a new, sleek and modern UI. These workspaces are now available in a dark or light theme and each user can choose which mode they prefer to work with. It is simple to switch on just click on the avatar and switch to light mode!

## Window enhancements

Messages timestamp and bubble grouping capabilities improve the consumer experience by making the conversation look simple and clear. This solves the problem of today where the engagement window displays the full timestamp, including day and time per each message, and separates messages even if they were sent consecutively- making the conversation look very busy. Brands will also have the ability to set the style of the send icon of the engagement window. A new "send icon" configuration will be added to the Engagement Window Studio.

This configuration will include a dropdown list with two options; an arrow (which is the current send icon) and a new paper plane.

## Web messaging: Enhanced Horizon theme

The enhanced horizon theme gives consumers a new sleek experience. It has been updated to include: a floating window with rounded corners at the bottom, emoji icon for desktop, a menu at the top (for web messaging only) & attachment icon (for web messaging only).
