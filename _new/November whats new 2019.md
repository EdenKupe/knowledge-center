## Light mode

A few months ago, LivePersonâ€™s agent and manager workspaces received a major facelift with a new, sleek and modern UI. These workspaces are now available in a dark or light theme and each user can choose which mode they prefer to work with. It is simple to switch on just click on the avatar and switch to light mode!
