## Light theme across LiveEngage UI

A few months ago, LiveEngage received a major facelift with a new, dark and modern UI. This month, the UI is now available in a light theme in addition to the dark theme. Each user can choose which theme they prefer to use across the product. To choose a theme,  just click on the avatar and select the mode you want to use.

## Report Builder upgrade

The predefined dashboards and data visualizations will now appear in a bright color-theme with a new widget that provides a quick visual snapshot of KPIs. New functionalities have also been added including: schedule and export to PDF format. The Report Builder infrastructure has been upgraded to the latest MicroStrategy version in order to increase performance, scalability and security across the platform.

## Engagement Window: Messages timestamp & bubble grouping

The engagement window now displays the full timestamp of messages, including day and time for each message, and separates messages even if they were sent consecutively. Messages timestamps and bubble grouping improve the consumer experience by making the conversation look simple and clear.

Brands will also have the ability to set the style of the send icon of the engagement window (the configuration will be added to the Engagement Window Studio). This configuration will include a dropdown list with two options; an arrow (the current send icon) and a paper plane (new icon).


## Automatically Unassign Conversations from Agents

LiveEngage will automatically unassign the agent from an ongoing conversation based on a set configuration, and return the conversation to the queue.  This feature helps brands better meet SLAs by re-assigning a conversation that has not been answered by an agent in the committed time frame. It also saves time and prevents human error for agents when closing shifts, by eliminating the need to manually return conversations to queue as it’s done automatically.

## Queue priority based on messaging source

Enables brands to capitalize on high converting channels or specific campaigns sent by channels by assigning extra velocity to conversations based on the messaging source the conversation is coming from. For example, brands can look at the data on incoming messages from whatsApp and decide that WhatsApp has higher conversion rates that other messaging channels and therefore, assign extra priority to conversations coming in from WhatsApp.

## Static load balancing - configure skill by parent agent groups

Static load balancing is a routing capability that allows brands to define how the messaging load will get distributed between different agent groups. For example, this capability is necessary for brands that outsource their messaging operations and must meet contractual obligations to define which vendor handles what percentage of the total brand’s messaging traffic.  With this new enhancement the configuration of the load distribution becomes more simple to define. 

## Bot connector: Support multiple messages 

Using a delay mechanism in the MS Bot Framework, you can now aggregate messages, structured content, images and actions into a single direct payload. The bot connector will then handle parsing into separate messages to appear on the consumer side.

## Conversation Rollover

Rollover provides brands with more flexibility to manage conversations with an answering service or third-party, outsourced agents.  The rollover capability enables brands to define the strategy and load management for enabling third-party conversation management.  

Brands outsourcing agents can use this capability in the following scenarios:
* Fully Managed: automatically transfer all incoming conversations to another account 
* Scheduled: transfer conversations to another account based on a configured schedule (e.g. nights & weekends) 
* Backup: transfer to answering service account only after brand has exceeded a predetermined SLA
* Hybrid: Combination of scheduled and backup.

## Network Manager

The Network Manager enables a single LiveEngageaccount (the main provider account) to route conversations to multiple, dedicated brand accounts. This gives brands the opportunity to connect with more consumers in more places by allowing conversations with a brand to begin on other providers' websites.

## Lead Service

Lead services allows brands to configure lead topics as well as collect, validate, and deliver lead information to email addresses and/or API endpoints based on lead topic assigned.  Lead specifications validate the information needed to create a new lead or opportunity in a brand's CRM.  Lead topics can be used to route certain types of leads to different CRM and/or email address endpoints as needed.
