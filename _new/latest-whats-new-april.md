## Performance Optimizer Intent Panel 
The new Performance Optimizer Intent Panel creates an intent-focused view. It answers the question of how effectively an operation resolves its consumersâ€™ intents, the customer experience impact, and provides clear and simple view(s) that prioritize areas of opportunity. It also provides clear action items to optimize the intent and operational performance.  These views will enable a Performance Optimizer user to understand the intent mix and nature of primary contact drivers into the operation and their evolution over time, while identifying intents suitable for automation, increasing efficiency and reducing operational expenditures. 

There are 3 primary components to the Intent Panel: 
* A heatmap graphic that will visually prioritize automation opportunities by intent 
* Automated text that contextualizes 4E performance by intent performance 
* Intent classification metrics and graphics 

The Intent Panel allows users to view the following metrics within the heatmap by intent for the LOB(s) selected: 
* Closed Conversations
* Closed Conversations % of Total
* Avg. Conversation Duration
* Agent Responses Per Closed Conversation
* MCS (normalized 1-100)

The Intent graphics shows the metrics below for the LOB(s) selected:
* Intentful Rate
* Classification Rate
* Total Messages
* Intentful Messages
* Classified Messages
* Unclassified Messages

The automated Intent Diagnostics section will include text that will contextualize performance and provide specific recommendations to improve performance leveraging intent data.
