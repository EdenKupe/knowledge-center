These release notes include new features arriving to LiveEngage during May 2020. Exact delivery dates may vary, and brands may therefore not have immediate access to all features on the date of publication.

The timing and scope of these features or functionalities remain at the sole discretion of LivePerson and are subject to change.

## Greeting for accepted transferred messaging conversations 
### Type: New feature (Bot Connectors 2.18)
The Bot Connector system is designed to respond to incoming messaging by the consumer, once the bot is engaged in the conversation. Enabling the Welcome Messages settings, allows Brands to compose an initial message that the bot can send out that is not in direct response to the consumers messages. This allows for the bot to connect to a conversation and send out an initial message without waiting for the consumer to send a message after the bot first joins the conversation.

## Private Messages (INT-635) 
### Type: New feature (Bot Connectors 2.18)
This feature will enable customers to leverage the UMS Private Text feature thus allowing customers to send Private Text messages via all supported AI vendors in third-party bots. Private text messages are only visible to the agent and manager in Agent Workspace and end users will not be able to see those messages.
