## Post conversation survey bots
### Type: New functionality (Conversation Builder)

This feature is available for all channels and for all customers.

{: .notice}
Before using this feature, it must be enabled in Conversation Builder by LivePerson. Contact your LivePerson account representative to have this configuration change made.
Description
In this release, Conversation Builder introduces survey bots, which you can create and manage directly within the Conversation Builder application.

A survey bot lets you collect feedback from consumers at the end of a conversation with a custom bot or human agent. The survey bot can ask:
Specialized questions designed to provide First Call Resolution (FCR), Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), and Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey metrics
Questions that reflect your brand's key performance indicators.

### Free-text questions
Use a survey bot to measure bot/agent and skill performance and to identify opportunities to improve on your quality targets.
Notes: 
To use survey bots created in Conversation Builder, you must be on the LivePerson Cloud platform, i.e., you log into Conversation Builder via single sign-on through LiveEngage. This feature isn't supported on the AWS platform where you log into Conversation Builder directly.
Survey bots are supported only in Messaging, not in Live Chat.
Before using this feature, it must be enabled in Conversation Builder by LivePerson. Please contact your LivePerson account representative to have this configuration change made. 

To enable, please contact your LivePerson account team

Description
In this release, we’ve enhanced the language support for simple and complex bots:
Simple bots: These are bots that don’t use Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for intent matching and instead rely on pattern matching. When you create a simple bot and set the bot’s language, you can now specify any language that’s desired. The list of available languages includes all those supported by available NLU providers (LivePerson, Google Dialogflow, and IBM Watson). If you don’t see the language that you need, you can select “Other” and specify the language.
Complex bots: These are bots that use some measure of NLU for intent matching. When you create a domain, you can now select from all languages supported by the NLU provider (LivePerson, Google Dialogflow, and IBM Watson). Previously, only a subset of the 3rd-party NLU provider’s languages were available.
Please note -- When you create a complex bot and set the bot’s language, take care to select the language of the domain that will be associated with the bot. Otherwise, errors will occur during NLU processing.
