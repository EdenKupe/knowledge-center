The new ‘Goals tracker for Messaging’ dashboard will now allow brands to measure the conversions for all agents participating in the consumer journey based on the cross-session window configuration in the account. This helps brands better attribute conversions to all the agents who were assigned to the conversation, as well as the ability to increase accountability and motivation. 

The new report will show data at the Brand, Agent and Skills level, alongside compelling data such as: assigned time and number of sent agent messages. This allows brands to make better decisions regarding the contribution of each agent to the achieved goal.

Please note: 
The existing ‘Goals Tracker Report’ will be renamed to ‘Goals Tracker for Live Chat’ and will include messaging data only for the next 6 months. It can be used for settings of First/Last agent only.
The Dashboard will show data only for sources that supports campaign in LiveEngage ( Web messaging and in app messaging)

### How to enable
The new Dashboard is enabled OOTB.
New settings will be added to LiveEngage UI to enable brands to choose the attribution model for messaging (First, Last, All). The window for consideration is the same cross session window defined in Live Engage UI.
The UI is not deployed yet, in order to change the setting to ‘All’  please contact the Live Person account team.
