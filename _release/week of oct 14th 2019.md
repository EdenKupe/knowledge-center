## Web experiences

### Type: Bug fix

**Available to all customers?** Yes

If the site setting ‘messaging.agent.photo.size’ was changed from the default 800px to a larger value, the consumer side would still downscale the image to 800px causing the image on the agent side to appear blurry.

This has now been fixed and consumer side will now take into consideration the value of ‘messaging.agent.photo.size’ so that the image is uploaded in the correct size.
