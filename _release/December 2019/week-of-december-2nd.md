Brands now have the ability to enable image sharing from consumers to agents, while allowing consumers to use the Google Business Messaging conversational interface to share images from their device with agents. 

Supported file formats and sizes:
* Image types: JPG, GIF, JPEG, PNG 
* Size: up to 10 MB
 
If the consumer sends an image that is not supported or image size is beyond the supported size, the agent will receive the image as a URL. If the file sharing has not been enabled, the consumer will see this message: “Sorry! Unfortunately files cannot be sent via Google.”

**Please note:** This feature requires enablement. For more information please contact your LivePerson representative.
