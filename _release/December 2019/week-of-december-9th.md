This feature is for existing or new MCS Toolkit customers. 
If you are interested in becoming an MSC toolkit customer, please contact your account manager.

Brands can now have greater control over who within the brand organization has access to MCS Toolkit data by specifying which profiles have access to MCS Toolkit.
Additionally, enabling this feature will also restrict data views for agent managers to only data related to the group(s) they manage.

**How to enable**
Please contact your account manager.
This feature works in tandem with the LiveEngage Apps feature. The Restrict Access by Profile feature will restrict login to MCS Toolkit based on the profiles in enabled for MCS Toolkit in LE Apps. A self-serve UI for managing app permissions will be available soon, but in the meantime, these permissions can be managed by your account team.
