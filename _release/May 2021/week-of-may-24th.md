## Commerce & Care views
### Type: Enhancement (Performance Optimizer 1.4)

The Performance Optimizer now supports two views: Care and Commerce.  The Commerce view exposes additional sales metrics to users including conversion rate, conversions, conversions per login hour, and average order value.  
The LivePerson 4E Framework incorporates these sales metrics when users select the Commerce View and identifies sales specific metrics for efficiency (conversion rate per login hour) and effectiveness (conversion rate).  The primary indicator of efficiency and effectiveness dynamically changes when the Commerce view is chosen by the user. 

| 4E Framework Primary Indicator  | Care  | Commerce | Panel with Dynamic Metric |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Efficiency | Closed Conversations Per Login Hour (CCPLH) | Conversions Per Login Hour | Executive Summary LOB Detail |
| Effectiveness | Repeat Contact Rate - 3 Day (RCR 3 Day) | Conversion Rate | Executive Summary LOB Detail |

There are 3 primary components to the new Care view: 
1. A separate and unique view for Commerce brands  
2. Updated 4E Framework metrics for Commerce brands
3. Dynamic Panels to reflect Commerce KPIs (as compared to Care)

* Conversions

### How to enable

## Data at Rest Encryption solution
### Enhancement
LivePerson has enhanced their Encryption solution. 
The encryption of data at rest in LivePerson refers to the encryption of conversation transcripts and Engagement Attributes on the LivePerson storage servers. 
Implementing a strong encryption method is crucial for protecting LP customers data from potential unauthorized access and for complying with laws and regulations dictated to LivePerson directly or indirectly by its customers.
