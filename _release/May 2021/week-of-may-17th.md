## Voice & Video for non web channels
###  Enhancement [Voice & video]
Brands that are using the third party messaging channels will now be able to invite consumers to video or voice calls. Agents will be able to send the video or voice call invitation from the Agent Workspace, while the specific channel will display the invite to the consumer. Consumers will be able to tap on the invite in order to initiate or decline the voice or video call, while the call will be facilitated via a webview outside the messaging app.
Enablement
First, brands will need to enable the voice and video call feature on the conversational Cloud account:
Voice and video calls are automatically enabled on the brand’s Conversational Cloud account. Agent Profiles and Permissions can be used to allow or restrict the video and voice calls feature for all agents or only a subset of agents. The permissions are part of the Agent profile. The permissions that control this feature are the “Initiate voice conversation” permission to allow voice calls, and the “Initiate live video conversation” permission to allow video calls.

Initiating a call
Voice or video calls are initiated by the agent by sending an invitation to the consumer on a Messaging channel.

The consumer has the ability to accept the invitation by clicking on the invitation link


After accepting, the call is initiated and the consumer’s browser will ask for permission to access the camera and/or microphone:

Consumers can close the webview at any point of the video or voice call while returning to the messaging screen.



Agent view:

Consumer View:


The video and voice calls will open within CC as a new video widget interface on conversation cloud.
During an active call, both agent and consumer are able to end the call at any time. Furthermore, each participant is able to mute the microphone or disable the camera:

Limitations
The link can only be sent in English and cannot be translated to a local language of the consumer.
