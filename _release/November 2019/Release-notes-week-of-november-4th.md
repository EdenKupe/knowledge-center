Proactive Messaging is an early access product

With LivePerson’s Proactive Messaging, brands can now send consumers outbound messages on channels like SMS & WhatsApp to initiate high value marketing and customer care conversations. Instead of relying on low conversion emails, or one-way messages that drive consumers to web pages or phone calls, Proactive Messaging allows consumers to respond to marketing campaigns and customer care alerts within the same conversation. This results in higher conversion rates, fewer calls and operational costs, and rich messaging experiences that increase consumer satisfaction.

### Benefits of using Proactive

* Create conversations, not spam (Marketing)

  Consumers overwhelmingly prefer messaging conversations to phone or email, and consumers that engage in messaging conversations are 3x more likely to make a purchase than those who don’t. Our two-way Proactive Messaging platform makes it easy to engage consumers with targeted campaigns, then respond to questions and sales inquiries in the same convenient conversation.
* Deliver better care at lower costs (Customer Care)

  Don’t make your consumers call and wait on hold to get support or information. Use Proactive Messaging to start conversations on topics like account updates or service outages to reduce inbound call and email volume and increase consumer satisfaction.
* (One platform for every channel and conversation Single Platform)

  LiveEngage is the industry’s leading conversation management platform. It offers a single place to manage inbound and outbound messages from every channel, and layers in powerful chatbots for better consumer experiences and lower operational costs. LiveEngage connects to back-end systems like CRMs, so that brands can easily manage marketing, sales, and customer care KPIs for proactive campaigns while getting a complete view of the entire consumer journey.
* When a brand’s agent or a bot receives a response from a consumer for a proactive message, they also receive the context of what the consumer is responding to.
* Direct consumers to the most appropriate agent pool or automations that can help the consumer in the most efficient manner possible.
* Measure the consumer’s satisfaction with the proactive conversations which will provide them a direct signal about the effectiveness of the brand’s proactive strategy.

### Getting started

* To get started, you need a LiveEngage account.
* If you are already a LiveEngage user, you will need to follow our onboarding process.
* The onboarding process consists of getting started with SMS [(see link)](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/getting-started-quick-start-guides-twilio-sms-quick-start.html) or WhatsApp ([see link](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/messaging-channels-whatsapp-business.html)).
* Contact your LivePerson account team by accessing [this form](https://forms.gle/wDBkzsCtT4CCQMFR9) to get your account configured.
* Once onboarded, navigate to Proactive Messaging app from the Quick Launch within LiveEngage.
* This will open Proactive Messaging in a new tab, from there you can start creating proactive campaigns by clicking on ‘New campaign’ option.

The Report Builder infrastructure has been upgraded to the latest Micro Strategy (MSTR) version in order to benefit from the performance, scalability and enhanced secure platform.

With the new infrastructure upgrade, there are some changes in terminology which are relevant mostly for users who have edit access:

* Dashboard ⇒ Dossier
* Sheet ⇒ Chapter
* Panel ⇒ Page

### Enhancements include: 

### Accessing the Report Builder 

The report builder can be accessed through the quick launch menu which is located on the bottom left of the navigation panel.

### New look and feel with a modern and bright color scheme

All Predefined dossiers have been enriched to include new data visualizations with a bright color-theme ( see screenshot below).  
!\[\](img/RB4_2.png)

### Navigation

Dossier navigation has been moved from the bottom of the dashboard to the top as well as having headings for each panel inside the sheet for effective navigation.

### KPI widget

New KPI Widget which will provide a quick visual snapshot of the current value of a KPI and how that KPI has changed over time.

!\[\](img/RB4_4.png)

1. Previous date value data
2. Trend Indicator ( X%) - shows the trend between Previous date and current. The color will be green to reflect an improvement in KPI and red for a negative change.
3. Trend Graph- shows the trend for the filtered date range.
4. Tooltips when hovering over the trend graph to see the date and value

### View only users experience

Clear presentation for users with ‘view only’ permission, the filter panel has moved from left to the right to allow the data to be in the main focus area.

### Additional data visualizations

New visualization types for creating custom dossiers (histogram, waterfall chart, box plot)

!\[\](img/RB4_5.png)

### New functionality includes:

### Exporting to PDF

Export dossiers to a formatted PDF file, including visualizations and advanced formatting options:

1. layout ( Automatic, Portrait, Landscape)
2. Advanced mode to export the visualizations individually on separate pages to include all data.

### Personalized view

Users can now save their own custom personal view of the dashboard. A personal view is a lightweight copy of a dashboard, and includes every change that was made to the dashboard including filtering the report period time frame and offset selector. It can be used to save time when choosing data to analyze and it allows you to define different views on the same dashboard without having to re select the filters on the dashboard.

* To create and save a personal view: go to the file menu, select ‘Create Personal View’ and change the name to a meaningful name.
* To run a personal view, after launching the Report Builder , select ‘My Subscriptions’ where you will see all your personal view subscriptions

In the Personal View Subscriptions area, click the name of the personal view to run it or edit it.

For example, you can create a view on the Agent Activity Dashboard for the last 30 days filtered for internal employees only and another view of the offshore team for the last 120 days.

{: .notice}**  
**These changes will only impact the predefined dashboards. User copies of previous predefined dashboards will not be impacted automatically.

If there is a need to update existing user copies of the dashboard to the new color palette, this can be done manually in the Report Builder:

After opening the required dossier, go to ‘Format’ Menu and choose ‘Custom Pallets’ -> LivePerson Palette and then save the changes.
