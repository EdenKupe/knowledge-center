{: .notice}  
Proactive Messaging is an early access product

With LivePerson’s Proactive Messaging, brands can now send consumers outbound messages on channels like SMS & WhatsApp to initiate high value marketing and customer care conversations. Instead of relying on low conversion emails, or one-way messages that drive consumers to web pages or phone calls, Proactive Messaging allows consumers to respond to marketing campaigns and customer care alerts within the same conversation. This results in higher conversion rates, fewer calls and operational costs, and rich messaging experiences that increase consumer satisfaction.

### Benefits of using Proactive

* Create conversations, not spam (Marketing)

  Consumers overwhelmingly prefer messaging conversations to phone or email, and consumers that engage in messaging conversations are 3x more likely to make a purchase than those who don’t. Our two-way Proactive Messaging platform makes it easy to engage consumers with targeted campaigns, then respond to questions and sales inquiries in the same convenient conversation.
* Deliver better care at lower costs (Customer Care)

  Don’t make your consumers call and wait on hold to get support or information. Use Proactive Messaging to start conversations on topics like account updates or service outages to reduce inbound call and email volume and increase consumer satisfaction.
* (One platform for every channel and conversation Single Platform)

  LiveEngage is the industry’s leading conversation management platform. It offers a single place to manage inbound and outbound messages from every channel, and layers in powerful chatbots for better consumer experiences and lower operational costs. LiveEngage connects to back-end systems like CRMs, so that brands can easily manage marketing, sales, and customer care KPIs for proactive campaigns while getting a complete view of the entire consumer journey.
* When a brand’s agent or a bot receives a response from a consumer for a proactive message, they also receive the context of what the consumer is responding to.
* Direct consumers to the most appropriate agent pool or automations that can help the consumer in the most efficient manner possible.
* Measure the consumer’s satisfaction with the proactive conversations which will provide them a direct signal about the effectiveness of the brand’s proactive strategy.
