The‘Messaging Performance Dashboard’ will be enhanced to include the Repeat contact Rate KPIs allowing brands to measure resolution rates, the amount of labor time the brand is spending due to unresolved conversations, which Skills/Groups have the highest RCR and are my Auto-close settings causing premature closures.

The RCR page was added to the Brand level chapter to allow analyzing the RCR rates on the brand and skill levels.
The RCR has several KPIs, according to the predefined buckets (RCR 1 hour, RCR 1 day, RCR 3 days etc).
