## [LE UI] New Instagram connector support in the Conversational Cloud
### Type: New Functionality (LE UI 12.8)

The Conversational Cloud will support the new Instagram connector as a new third-party messaging channel in the data sources. Agents will be able to see all the pages that are currently connected to the respective Instagram handles. Additionally they would be able to subscribe to the new handles and unsubscribe from the existing one’s making the onboarding of Instagram quick and easy for the brands.

Another advantage that brands will have that the agents would be able to configure the Ice breakers aka conversation starters during the onboarding process. Ice breakers provide a way for the consumers to start a conversation with the business with a list of frequently asked questions. A maximum of 4 questions can be set by the agents during the self service onboarding process via Data sources in the conversation cloud.
