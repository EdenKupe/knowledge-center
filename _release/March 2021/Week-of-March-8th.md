## AssessingÂ the same secure form multiple times
### Type: Enhancement (Secure Forms)
The option to assess the same form multiple times is configurable (specifically for Web). 
Brands can define how many times a consumer will be able to reopen the same secure form prior to submitting it. 
This is useful for brands to allow consumers to broswe back and forth different pages (e.g. collecting customer ID) during the conversation while filling out the secure form while keeping it accessible.In order to configure, please contact your LivePerson account team.

## Return source name in the response 
### Type: Enhancement (Messaging History Interactions API version 1.1.0.61)
The source of the API call, which is sent by the API consumer, will now be returned in the API response. The source name will be mirrored and will be added automatically, in the case of pagination, to the URLs used as reference to the next, previous, first, and last pages in the response.
This will allow brands to add the source name only for the first call, while follow-up calls can be taken directly from the response, and without need to concatenate manually.
