## Connect to Messaging 2.0
### Type: New Functionality (C2M 2.0)

LivePerson’s Connect To Messaging (C2M) is an IVR deflection solution that lets brands offer their consumers the option to move from voice calls to messaging. Once consumers opt to deflect to a messaging conversation, they will receive an outbound message via either SMS, WhatsApp or the brand’s mobile app, which they can respond to and start having a two-way conversation with the brand. The consumer’s responses are routed into the Agent Workspace, where conversations can be handled by human agents, automation, or a tango of both. SMS, WhatsApp and App Messaging are supported messaging channels for Connect to Messaging at this time. Connect To Messaging IVR solution moves voice calls to messaging platforms to create two way conversations.

* **Brand onboarding:** 100% easy and quick self-service onboarding and configuration. Account managers or CSM’s can enable C2M 2.0 service on behalf of their brands directly from the Conversational Cloud platform.
* **New C2M 2.0 API:** Highly reliable skill based routing by leveraging platform campaigns, and engagement capability and eliminating bot routing features in the previous version. Add new rate limits for API rate throttling to avoid any DDos attacks and limit the time interval to download reporting data.  The new rate limit will be 30 Req/ sec for all the channels combined. The brand agents can now view the first outbound message in the conversation transcript window instead of separate agent widget.   
* **Role-based access to the C2M webtool:** Only campaign managers or administrator brand users can create, manage API Configurations, WhatsApp message templates through the Connect To Messaging (C2M) web tool.
* **New channel - IVR deflection to App Messaging:** C2M 2.0 API has released the new message channel to support brands mobile app (In-App) which runs for IOS and Android platforms. 
  * **In-App First Message:** Build the new CX- widget in the agent workspace to display top five In-App first outbound messages in the last 30 days.
* **Reporting 2.0:** Release a new reporting 2.0 API endpoint to provide full funnel analytics and transactions data for SMS and WhatsApp channels.
