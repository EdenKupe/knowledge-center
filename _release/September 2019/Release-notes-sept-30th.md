This feature defines a set of configurations that would enable brands to achieve finer control over what kind of scenarios would trigger the auto-close mechanism to reset its countdown to conversation close per a specific conversation. The new configuration will enable the control if a conversation auto-close timer should be reset or not when a conversation:

* Was opened for viewing without having the viewing agent join the conversation (joins just as a READER).
* Was joined by an agent/agent manager/admin as an active participant in the conversation.

Besides these new configurations, writing a line in the conversation or changing its state would still reset the auto-close timer.

Enables brands to configure a data-masking regex which leaves the final four digits of credit card numbers unmasked. This is an addition to the recently released data-masking feature which masks the entire credit card of object matching the regex. Clients who choose the leave the final four digits of credit cards unmasked can track and audit messages while retaining consumer privacy.

## Static load balancing 

### Type: Enhancement

 As part of the Static Load Balancing feature, a conversationâ€™s allocated group field, used to route conversations to specific agent groups, will be set based on the resuming agent group ID.   
The above action would take place only if the Load Balancing feature is Enabled by your LivePerson account team.
