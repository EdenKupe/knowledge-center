Messaging load distribution is a routing capability that allows brands to define how would the messaging load gets distributed between different agent groups. This kind of capability is a necessity for brands that outsource their messaging operations and must meet clear contractual obligations as to which vendor handles which percentage of the total brand messaging traffic. It allows the brand to define that a specific agent group is correlated with a specific vendor and define, per skill, the way that the load will be distributed between the agent groups.

This feature is available to all customers. It is already available for Chat and now also available for Messaging)

**How to enable**

LP Account manager to enable the feature - “Messaging.Static_Load_Balancing”

Configuring a load balancing per a specific skill is then made available through the Skills settings screen in LiveEngage. The account must have at least 2 agent groups in order for the feature to become visible in the UI.

**Dependencies**

* AC-users 5.3
* UMS 3.22
* LE-UI 10.12

{: .notice}  
This feature cannot be defined to work for both Messaging and Chat load balancing per a single skill.
