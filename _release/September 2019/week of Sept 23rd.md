The new LE mobile app version include the following new features:

### Transfer to skill

LE mobile app users can now transfer conversation to other skills.   
From the conversation action menu, user can select the new “Transfer conversation” button.   
The “Transfer conversation” dialog box displays all the relevant skill that the conversation can be transferred to (the login is defined in the LiveEngage platform).   
To transfer the conversation, user needs to select the required skill and then tap on the transfer button.

### Viewing photos sent by consumer

The LE mobile app now supports viewing photos sent by the consumer.   
When consumer sends a photo, it will be presented in the transcript in thumbnail view.   
Tapping on the image will open it in full view mode

### Sending photo to consumer

Users can now send photos from the LiveEngage mobile app to the consumers. If the conversation source (Connector) supports receiving photos from agent an “camera” button will be available in the input area bar. User can share photos from the device photo library or take photos using the device camera. 

### Push notification enhancements

Up until now, there was a limitation that for a period of one minute after the app moves to the background, push notifications were not sent. In the new version, the push notification will start working as soon as the app is moved to the background.

### Session expired indication

If for some reason the LiveEngage mobile app session expired (e.g. the same user login to the LiveEngage web) an indication will presented in the app and the app will be logged out
