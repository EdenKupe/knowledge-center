The ‘Operational & Staffing for Live Chat’ was enhanced to allow brands to analyze the converted consumers versus the control group and self served visitors groups.

Control group visitors -  Visitors who were not exposed to any engagement in their site journey either they were in a control group or prospects who aren't exposed to invites.
