The ‘Operational & Staffing for Live Chat’ was enhanced to allow brands to analyze the converted consumers versus the control group and self served visitors groups.

Self service visitors -  Visitors who were exposed to an invite, but did not have any engagement/chat  and converted on the web site ( they might clicked on content but they didn't start a chat)
Control group visitors -  Visitors who were not exposed to any engagement in their site journey either they were in a control group or prospects who aren't exposed to invites.

Previously,  the report  included only Chat group metrics for visitors that end up in interactive chats. In this version we added the following groups.
