## Messaging Sales Metrics by Control Group and Self Service Group. 
### Enhancement (Analytics Builder 4.7)

Available to all customers? Y (Analytics Builder enabled) 


The ‘Business Dashboard for Messaging’ was enhanced to allow brands to analyze the converted consumers versus the control group and self served visitors groups.

Self service visitors -  Visitors who were exposed to an invite, but did not have any engagement/messaging conversion  and converted on the web site ( they might clicked on content but they didn't start a messaging conversion)
Control group visitors -  Visitors who were not exposed to any engagement in their site journey either they were in a control group or prospects who aren't exposed to invites ( which means they were eligible customers)

Previously,  the dashboard included only Messaging  group metrics for visitors that end up in interactive messaging conversations. In this version we added the following metrics.
